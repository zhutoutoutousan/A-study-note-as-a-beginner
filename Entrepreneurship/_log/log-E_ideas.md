### Data structure, random process, how mind works
I've been starting to think about how the mind works in a view of data structure and algorithms, 
The key is, adding sort of random process imitating a human subconscious, so how does it manifest it self in a model of a hybrid data structure?

However, in these three paths, experimental and theoretical approaches are hindered by the barriers of scale and complexity. How can we scale up cellular phenotyping and deal with the dynamics of cellular properties to achieve a comprehensive census of cell types in mammalian brains? How can we rise to the challenge of volume, time and dynamics in full connectome mapping potentially even down to the nanoscale? How can we trace all the molecular and cellular mechanisms that give rise to brain function and behavior?
To transcend these barriers, simulation neuroscience was born. It is arguably the next phase of brain research, after its philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. Simulation neuroscience combines experimental and theoretical approaches to achieve a dense digital reconstruction of the brain consistent with experimental data, which in itself forms a unifying theory of brain structure and function and which can be used to test and evolve new theories
