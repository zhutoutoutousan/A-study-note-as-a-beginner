# Explore the definition for a **study framework**
- Theoretical
  - High-level 
    - A framework prompts you to think in a certain pattern or a path, like what hooks in the ```react``` does, which, in long-term, can be beneficial.
    - A framework should be either opinionated or unopinionated, but the best case scenarios is for every individual from different fields to adjust/fine tune their study methods and according tools and utilities.
    - A framework should take the psychological, physiological and intellectual status of the user into the equation.
    - A framework should be able to constantly absorb the evidence-based scientific research concerning study as well as the anecdotal stories and upgrade itself.
  - Low-level
    - Functionality
      - A intellectual coach
        - Customized active-recall tools
      - An information hub
        - All information should be strongly coupled together
        - Customized study tools for a certain task
