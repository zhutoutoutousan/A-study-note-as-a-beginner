# IT Sophistication Improvement Commitment(2022/2/13-2023/2/13)
## Origin and basic planning - 2022/2/13
- I'm pretty frustrated that French is still the major limiting factor of fully comprehending Les Psychologie des Foules, guess your hunger for specific knowledge and idiosyncrasies of reading in original text have to be satisfied a bit later or slower
    - It is not that important compared to expediting your IT SOPHISTICATION, which your ass has been PROCRASTINATING cuz you think you have enough mental and existential composure to deflect it, it's time to remove this bit by bit
- About building up your sense of urgency to put TRULY CRAZY amount of effort into software for expedited development, DO IT TO CONSOLIDATE IT
    - Setting hard lowest time limit for IT related activities, if a job takes up the time, great, if resting, fill her up until it is satisfied
       - Parameter
           - Minimum time spent: 4 hrs?
               - Criteria
               - Trial and Error strategy
           - DURATION: 2023/2/13
       - RÃ©sistance
             - OMG, I may get sick
             - OMG, I have enough asset now, why all that effort
       - Action :
           - IF sick: Gracefully downgrade to the point where you can still crank up a few reps & Limit interprersonal contact for avoiding being eliminated for two weeks
           - PLAN: Plan your minimum hours
           - METHOD: Use Uhr to log your time
           - OPTION: Use termux to read code
           - CHANGE: Your circadian rhythm is toast and action items are clear but you're in denial --> Work from ground truth --> Instill motivation by logging experience of circadian rhythm recovery by practice
       - MOTIVATION
           - It won't last forever
