# IT Sophistication Improvement Commitment(2022/2/13-2023/2/13)
## Origin and basic planning - 2022/2/13
- I'm pretty frustrated that French is still the major limiting factor of fully comprehending Les Psychologie des Foules, guess your hunger for specific knowledge and idiosyncrasies of reading in original text have to be satisfied a bit later or slower
    - It is not that important compared to expediting your IT SOPHISTICATION, which your ass has been PROCRASTINATING cuz you think you have enough mental and existential composure to deflect it, it's time to remove this bit by bit
- About building up your sense of urgency to put TRULY CRAZY amount of effort into software for expedited development, DO IT TO CONSOLIDATE IT
    - Setting hard lowest time limit for IT related activities, if a job takes up the time, great, if resting, fill her up until it is satisfied
       - Parameter
           - Minimum time spent: 4 hrs?
               - Criteria
               - Trial and Error strategy
           - DURATION: 2023/2/13
       - RÃ©sistance
             - OMG, I may get sick
             - OMG, I have enough asset now, why all that effort
       - Action :
           - IF sick: Gracefully downgrade to the point where you can still crank up a few reps & Limit interprersonal contact for avoiding being eliminated for two weeks
           - PLAN: Plan your minimum hours
           - METHOD: Use Uhr to log your time
           - OPTION: Use termux to read code
           - CHANGE: Your circadian rhythm is toast and action items are clear but you're in denial --> Work from ground truth --> Instill motivation by logging experience of circadian rhythm recovery by practice
       - MOTIVATION
           - It won't last forever

    - Well, AWS took way too much time
    - Must sleep, it's just a start, don't beat yourself to death
- 2022/2/15
  - Difficulty
    - INTENSITY TOO HIGH?
      - When getting up, I feel like I'm going to faint
    - What the fxxk should I do now?

    - Not good enough, but the second day, I would still be tolerant
    - For Java I started to real *learning java* like a novel, lots of them are familiar and not so important, so I can progress 100 pages per hour, up until the `bean` part I guess, Spring Boot is more important
    - AWS is taking a bit less time, and the progress is getting stabler so you can pretty much estimate the time of completion, but the problem is, it usually is the time you start to be anxious because there is a tangible progress that you can attack your *genious self-image* with
- 2022/2/16
  - Change
    - The AWS TimeOverflow problem is caused by `recording time by passed video length`, which excludes the debugging, documentation reading, following along and additional research
      - 30 Minutes passed video length corresponds to 1 hour~1.5hour of AWS osmosis-style learning
  - Recovery
    - Pitch-black sleeping environment and earlier sleep time is the key to avoid I-am-in-bed-and-awake-the-whole-night for the time being
  - New Mental Procedures
    - FORCING YOURSELF TO GET BACK FROM DISTRACTION 
      - This mental procedure, used to be very strong if enough mental supports are present
      - This entire `_COMMITMENT` section will serve as necessary `mental support` for the time being
  - Naysaying elements
    - I expect this will emerge after a few days or weeks
