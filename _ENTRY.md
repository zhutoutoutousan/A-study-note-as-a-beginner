# Explore the definition of **study framework**
## Basic idea
- Theoretical
  - High-level 
    - A framework prompts you to think in a certain pattern or a path, like what hooks in the ```react``` does, which, in long-term, can be beneficial.
    - A framework should be either opinionated or unopinionated, but the best case scenario is for every individual from different fields to adjust/fine tune their study methods and according tools and utilities.
    - A framework should take the psychological, physiological and intellectual status of the user into the equation.
    - A framework should be able to constantly absorb the evidence-based scientific research concerning study as well as the anecdotal stories and upgrade itself.
    - A framework should train or assist you to build a higher-dimensional '**hashmap**' to reduce your effort to retain neural patterns or pathways with time complexity of $O(1)$ which without the help could be $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$ or worse
      - For a human, time complexity is important, because the life of a man is limited at the time this acclaim is made, and with the development of electronics, we could find a way to reduce time complexity for a human to optimize the process of building or strengthening a neural pattern/pathway with the compensations of increased space complexity
  - Low-level
    - Functionality
      - A intellectual coach
        - Customized active-recall tools
        - Training plan and monitor system for fluid-like neural patterns
      - An information hub
        - All information should be strongly coupled together
        - Customized study tools for a certain task
      - Recommendation system
- Practical
  - SE implementation
    - Cybersecurity
  - Entities to consider
    - Marginnote
    - Mindmap e.g. Xmind
    - Game experience
      - Minecraft
      - CYPHER
    - Flashcard
    - Knowledge graph
    - Neuroscience <--> Study theory
  - Features
    - Flexibility(Similar to Difficulty settings in video games)
      - The most advanced user should be able to program how the framework works
        - API reference
        - Technical documentations
      - The average user should be able to enjoy encapsulated settings
        - In-game settings
      - The minor user should be able to quickly achieve their goal
        - State your purposes, automatic configuration

## Integration from great gaming experiences
- Iconic game references
  - Mass effect 3
  - GTA V
- Game mechanics
  - Unlock system
  - Save game
    - Great for workplaces where frequent interruptions are inevitable
  - Difficulty curves design
    - You play the game instead of games playing you
  - CODEX
    - When you are lost in a video game like **Mass effect 3**, you can check the codex to know more about the in-game world
    - The level of complexity and scale should be on par or slightly extensive with that of the user

# Heuristic
- **DISCLAIMER** As a self-explanatory title, these contents only serve as references
## When exactly is optimal for framework activation?
- General
  - <span style="color: lime">DO</span> Reoccuring concepts, knowledge, thought patterns/neural pathways that surpass the threshold which is determined by the individual's goal, status and more.
  - <span style="color: lime">DO</span> Needs for conceptual structure
- Software development
  - <span style="color: red">DON'T</span> For **technical documents**, it's useless to rewrite the instruction manual 
    - <span style="color: lime">DO</span> But it could be useful to speed read it and write down what content you should be paying attention to the next time you start speed reading it.
  - <span style="color: lime">DO</span> Eat chicken and broccoli every day
- Scenarios to use **Training coach**
