  - Process 1(Speed reading, only for answering some questions)
    - Progress:
    - Questions
      - What was the definition of *deep work* according to the author?
        - Boredom --- 92/190
      - What was the entity that is on the opposite side of *deep work*?
        - Random, trivial, disrupting tasks --- 84/190
        - It is a chornic syndrome --- 94/190
          - So what kind of work style can be categorized as *multitask?* Can you describe its significance? Passing what threshold will drastically pitfall your working efficiency? What are the nuances among everything in between or within higher dimensions?
            - [wiki - human multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking)
    - Doubts
      - 94/190 This book is not for me or what? So I am waiting in a queue, and I grab my smartphone, and I started to study Italian, brick by brick. This is not distraction. Ok, defense mechanism aside, what it implies also, is **we can fill those time fragments with some activities that improves the systems in our brain or whatever** to the daily life
      - 94/190 Of course I agree on **NOT taking breaks from distraction but take breaks from focus**, WTH should I NOT do that?
      - 100/190 I don't find meditating interesting anymore. When I get up, usually I start straight to work, or review my notebook
      - 127/190 Interesting point, it's $E_{consumed}=INTENSITY\times TIME$
      - 134/190 **HERE IS WHAT I WANT**: **HOW TO QUANTIFY THE DEPTH OF EVERY ACTIVITY**, I don't want to make a list, because I just don't want to. I want to **PUT IT INTO CODE, AND MAKE A PROGRAM TO DO THIS JOB**,**AS LONG AS WHATEVER THIS AUTHOR ACCLAIMS WORKS**
        - **PROGRAMMING EXERCISE???**: Design or Find out a programm that can weight your schedule and automatically sort by your daily routine and importance.
      - 142/190 Here are some VERY GOOD AND PRAGMATIC strategies for people working in non-entry-knowledge level jobs or academia to achieve *deep work*

        - Why
          - Carlo M. Cipolla opinion on stupid people
            - My take: If a node doesn't have enough level of sophistication or due to other reasons, failed to uphold a belief, code of conduct, respect for rules, tangible drive for rational interest(wealth, position, admittance, value) etc., then to this node, their core interest will be the net gain of happiness hormone(Oxytocin, testosterone, seretonin, etc.), the capriscous, obsolete part of human nature and there are millions of indecent ways to short-circuit it thus causing chaos around this node. We see stupid people acting as like they have net loss, but in their minds, that tempoary excretion of happiness hormone may be drug to them to survive the day due to their overtly suffering or mal-education, that sums up to 80% of their world while others only 2%

          - FIRST EXPERIENCE: Screw it, another book full of words and touchy-feelies but not enough models, insights. Pain in the ass to convert it to code, why are human beings so inefficient? Is there a way to hack it for mankind? Oh, Shakesphere, that's going to make it much less efficient, playing with words thinking that it can reflect more on human nature, sorry, I beg to differ
