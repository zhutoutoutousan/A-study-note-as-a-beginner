        - Aha
          - Record the context of every valid, effective **save & quit** scenarios for huge-timechunk-demanding, concentration-demanding, context-heavy workload and try to extract the basic principle from it
        - Principle
          - Having all information in one place
            - Build a single trusted system
              - You need ALL the data in one place to properly prioritize
                - Context switch between all the proprietary systems(if not yours, it's proprietary to you) are very high
              - Brain dump interface
                - List everything in your head
                - Integrate it with your system
                - Caveat: Rig them with your internal scheduler
        - R&R Strategy
          - Statistic: High Performing people - 57min on, 17 min off
          - Current State: Hybrid, a little bit of everything?
          - For you Pomodoro simply doesn't work, when you enter maximum deep work state, you simply sit there for hours or days

        - Important Concepts
          - Integrators VS Segmentor
            - 70% of the workforce is identified as integrators, 20% of them don't like that
            - VERDICT Rigorous Integrator
              - The final scheduler you have will be close to a CPU kernel, you get the gist
          - Introvert VS Extrovert
            - VERDICT Ambivert/Introvert, not the limiting factor
        - IMPLEMENTATION
          - CONTEXT
            - TASK Describe one of your craziest day would be, sort the context with the course context above
          - IMPROVEMENT
        - DISCOVERED NET LOSS SOURCE
          - As a highly rigorous integrator, you want to have a unified system both for work and life, there's a frequent context switch between the two as per now, which contributes to GROUND-TRUTH-LEVEL NET LOSS
            - For entrepreneurial individuals, the idyllic picture of clear sense of boundry can be just as hard as being productive, unless there's a product that can bridge this chasm
            - Underlying opportunity: Is there a way to bridge this chasm of systems since 70% of the workforce is identified as integrators
