      - Record the context of every valid, effective **save & quit** scenarios for huge-timechunk-demanding, concentration-demanding, context-heavy workload and try to extract the basic principle from it
    - Principle
      - Having all information in one place
        - Build a single trusted system
          - You need ALL the data in one place to properly prioritize

    - Important Concepts
      - Integrators VS Segmentor
        - 70% of the workforce is identified as integrators, 20% of them don't like that
        - VERDICT Rigorous Integrator
          - The final scheduler you have will be close to a CPU kernel, you get the gist
      - Introvert VS Extrovert
        - VERDICT Ambivert/Introvert, not the limiting factor
    - IMPLEMENTATION
      - CONTEXT
        - TASK Describe one of your craziest day would be, sort the context with the course context above
      - IMPROVEMENT
    - DISCOVERED NET LOSS SOURCE
      - As a highly rigorous integrator, you want to have a unified system both for work and life, there's a frequent context switch between the two as per now, which contributes to GROUND-TRUTH-LEVEL NET LOSS
        - For entrepreneurial individuals, the idyllic picture of clear sense of boundry can be just as hard as being productive, unless there's a product that can bridge this chasm
        - Underlying opportunity: Is there a way to bridge this chasm of systems since 70% of the workforce is identified as integrators
