# Training system for academia
- As bodybuilders and powerlifters turns pro, the training mechanism gets more sophistication, actually the complexity and the level of multi-lateralism increases exponentially(#卷起来了). However, it is different in the academia world, **the effective training system for academia to the micro-level for extended period of time integrated with advanced methodology and IT support** almost doesn't exist, the methods are limited to the anecdotal level as traditional pedagogy currently facing the digital transformation and flawed, political collusion and interest-packed scientific research results and the education system is, as usual, decades behind the present. Why doesn't it exist as most people's academic learning mechanism and system stopped evolving after uni for lack of pre-vision of its usage --> The undercurrent is actually evolving, a lot of people, as the digital age emerges, started to do this
  - 商业机密, 竞争等问题--> this can only serve as intellectual dark web-ish
  - Intuition: This will move lots of people's cheese

[TOPIC] 同步笔记软件
可以分成展示型和实用型, 然后展示型用作个人IP, 然后实用型作为Ground-truth level的效率最大化, 结合神经科学, 学习理论, 工具等, 然后部署逻辑最好是实用型 --展示模板 --自动化部署--> 展示型 (可额外编辑) just my 2 cents   

REASONING: 
ATHLEAN-X, Jeff Cavaliere: 肌肉不管你的训练方法, 它只知道几点: 强度(Intensity)和运动范围(Range of Motion)

PAIN POINT(ASSUMED):
笔记可以解耦成展示型(受众比较喜欢UI炫酷的东东 Human centered design), 实用型(大脑的精准定位, 精准刺激, 对大脑刺激-----ValueChain-----> 给XXX带来的价值的清晰感知, 社群感, RemoteWorld/Metaverse) --> I don't know the pain point entry at this time cuz it's pretty damn hard to come up with one

HYPOTHESIS
大脑同样如此, 什么Brain stimulation journey map是最高效的, 对不同人群是不是有共通的神经刺激方法(Collective Unconsciousness) --> 精准定位, 精准刺激  在现今信息不对称的屏障仅剩一层窗户纸的大环境下, 不应停留于Anecdotal level --> Require significantly more knowledge for furthur discussion
