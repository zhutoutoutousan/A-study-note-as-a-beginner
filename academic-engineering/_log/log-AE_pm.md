Partially agree, especially for software development, during which well-placed comments and self-explanatory code style is king. But for the paper salvage and republish operation, we need to perform multiple stages of actions: 1. Client identification & engagement, in this case, it is about researching the best target publishers, ranking the 5 top most suitable publishers, identifying the key papers most likely to be accepted, and whether acceptance would benefit us most, timeline Gantt chart etc. In this phase, we need to create a sheet to store our potential clients. 2. Set up team readiness: We need to have keen sense of academia context, academic writing expertise, research ability, Tools & Automation(Including Web Crawler for the target field to automate the process), Academic Rigor(STEM field knowledge, ), Hiring and onboarding(Look for some reliable team players) 3. Brainstorming phase: There's more 4. Development phase: There's more 5. Deliver phase(Paper writing, Hand off)
