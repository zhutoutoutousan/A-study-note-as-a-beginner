## Research paradigms
- A research paradigm is a set of commonly held beliefs and assumptions within a research community about ontological, epistemological, and methodological concerns. The chapter starts with introducing the two most established research paradigms, positivism and interpretivism, and discusses their role in design science research. The chapter also presents two alternative research paradigms, critical realism and critical theory, and how these can influence design science work.
