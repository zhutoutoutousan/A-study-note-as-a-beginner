- *Briefly put, game and economic theory are concerned with the interactive behavior of **Homo rationalis** - rational man. **Homo rationalis** is the species that always acts both purposefully and logically, has well-defined goals, is motivated solely by the desire to approach thes egoals as closely as possible, and has the calculating ability required to do so.* --- (Aumann, 1985, p.35)
