# A
## Artificial agent
# B
## Behavioral game theory
# C
## Cooperative game theory
- ~ assumes that the players can communicate, form coalitions and sign binding agreements.
- ~ has been used, to analyze voting behavior and other issues in political science and related fields.
# D
## Decision tree
# G
## Game theory
- Traditionally, game theory has focused on interaction among intelligent, sophisticated and rational individuals.
# I
## Interactive situation
- Situations where several "entities", called *players*, take actions that affect each other.


# M 
## Minimax 
- **Minimax**(**MM**) is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory
# N
## Nash equilibrium
## Non-cooperative game theory
- The players are either unable to communicate or are able to communicate but cannot sign binding contracts.
  - Example
    - Former
    - Latter
      - Interaction among firms in an industry in an environment where antitrust laws make it illegal for firms to reach agreements concerning prices or production quotas or other forms of collusive behavior
