# Why bother learning?
- Lay the foundation for Web development
- I want to know how web cookies, cache works
- I want to be more adept at coding web interfaces with the back end
- I want to build up the mental model of the networking part of the web development
- I want to feel more comfortable when talking or learning about anything related with networking in the future(long-term)


# Visual intelligence
## Basic visual symbols
- CNTD - p29-30
## Network
### General network
- CNTD - p29-30
  - A glimpse into the overall network system
  - Some typical graphicing illustrative icon of some network elements
  - Illustrative analogies of how Packet-switched networks work
- Access networks
  - CNTD P39
### Household network
- DSL internet access
  - CNTD p40

## Splitting service
- AON
- PON
# Use of analogies
## Packet-switched network
- Containers processing in the docks
  - CNTD: P30
## Internet socket
- Sending a letter using the postal service
  - CNTD: P30
## Internet Protocol
- Human interactions
  - CNTD: P33
  - In human protocals, there are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events
  - Different protocols, on the vantage point of human interactions, may be the mannerisms, grasps of the concept or meaning of the message etc..

# Common sense
## Network
### Household network
The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
- A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
- A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
- An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4kHz
