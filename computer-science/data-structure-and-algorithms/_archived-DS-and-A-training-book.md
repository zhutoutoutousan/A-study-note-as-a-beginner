# What is learned
- Coding along `javascript-algorithm` is a bad idea, at least for this one. Remember why people use straps when doing the deadlift? It's for focusing on the posterior chain without the limiting factor of the grip strength. In this case, your muscle memory and the typing proficiency, or even the code-hand connection are not the limiting factor. The true limiting factors are: 
  - **Construction of neural pathways for problem solving techniques**
  - **Construction of mental model for algorithms and data structure** 
  - **Connection between ideas/mental models/neural pathways and code implementation**
  - **Problem solving proficiency**
