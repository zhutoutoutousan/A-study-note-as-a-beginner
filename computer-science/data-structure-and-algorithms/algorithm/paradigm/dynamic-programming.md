# Basic procedure
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information

# Usage
## Rod cutting problem
- Problem description: 
  - Given a rod of length $n$ inches and a table of prices $p_i$ for $i=1,2,...,n$, determine the maximum revenue $r_n$ obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.
