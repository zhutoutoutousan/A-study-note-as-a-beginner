- *just-in-time* compilers
  - Translate the bytecodes into machine lagnnuage immediately before they run the intermediate program to process the input.
- What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
- A compiler that translates a high-level language into another
high-level language is called a source-to-source translator. What advantages are
there to using C as a target language for a compiler?

## Language processors
- What advantages are there to a language-processing system in
which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?
