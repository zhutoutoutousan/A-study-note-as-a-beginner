## Algorithm
- An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some values, or sets of values, as **output**.
- An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
## Alpha-beta pruning
- **Alpha-beta pruning** is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.
