# Why study [what]
## Analog circuit design
- Ultimately, all circuitry functions according to analog principles. This gives an opportunity to identify abnormal activities of digital systems. For neuroengineering, this could be very important.
- Your major is Electrical Engineering... right? And you do want to study master... right?
