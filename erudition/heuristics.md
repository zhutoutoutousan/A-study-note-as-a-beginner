# Methodologies
## Immersive guided entry
- Free to access the information or logic chain in a concise and self-paced manner whilst retaining the rhythm of guided tutoring
- Intended to guide an individual to be an independent learner of the target field
## Cheatsheets
- It seems that you cheatsheet methods corresponds to **WHAT WORKS WHEN LEARNING LANGUAGES** as a intermediate or advanced learner to **quickly and evenly retain mental sharpness for intended area and tasks**
- It probably doesn't work for beginners for its loss of value of being compact
- Perhaps you should put it into your schedule
- And you should probably develop your personal cheatsheet, *globally* I mean over the years
- There is an amazing aspect about cheatsheet
  - If there is an area of field the knowledge structure of which is almost or entirely identical to one that you know inside-out, you can use cheatsheet as the entry instead of experience.(CTRL+C, CTRL+V tada~)
    - Say you've reached **Spanish C2 level**, you could just use **cheatsheet** to boost your **Portuguese** to reach independent level in the matter of days
    - We could list more scenarios that resemble the above
- The opinionated saying that **anyone has his own way of learning** could be effectively challenged and profitted by coming up with a solution that identifies the feasibility of CTRL+C & CTRL+V process by a verified muti-dimentional matching algorithm
## Controlled flush of information
- Control the outlet of information input as to serve for intentive purposes
# Strange thinking
