  - Process 1(Speed reading, only for answering some questions)
    - Progress:
    - Questions
      - What was the definition of *deep work* according to the author?
        - Boredom --- 92/190
      - What was the entity that is on the opposite side of *deep work*?
        - Random, trivial, disrupting tasks --- 84/190
        - It is a chornic syndrome --- 94/190
          - So what kind of work style can be categorized as *multitask?* Can you describe its significance? Passing what threshold will drastically pitfall your working efficiency? What are the nuances among everything in between or within higher dimensions?
            - [wiki - human multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking)
    - Doubts
      - 94/190 This book is not for me or what? So I am waiting in a queue, and I grab my smartphone, and I started to study Italian, brick by brick. This is not distraction. Ok, defense mechanism aside, what it implies also, is **we can fill those time fragments with some activities that improves the systems in our brain or whatever** to the daily life
      - 94/190 Of course I agree on **NOT taking breaks from distraction but take breaks from focus**, WTH should I NOT do that?
      - 100/190 I don't find meditating interesting anymore. When I get up, usually I start straight to work, or review my notebook
      - 127/190 Interesting point, it's $E_{consumed}=INTENSITY\times TIME$
      - 134/190 **HERE IS WHAT I WANT**: **HOW TO QUANTIFY THE DEPTH OF EVERY ACTIVITY**, I don't want to make a list, because I just don't want to. I want to **PUT IT INTO CODE, AND MAKE A PROGRAM TO DO THIS JOB**,**AS LONG AS WHATEVER THIS AUTHOR ACCLAIMS WORKS**
        - **PROGRAMMING EXERCISE???**: Design or Find out a programm that can weight your schedule and automatically sort by your daily routine and importance.
      - 142/190 Here are some VERY GOOD AND PRAGMATIC strategies for people working in non-entry-knowledge level jobs or academia to achieve *deep work*

# Methodologies
## Immersive guided entry
- Free to access the information or logic chain in a concise and self-paced manner whilst retaining the rhythm of guided tutoring
- Intended to guide an individual to be an independent learner of the target field
## Cheatsheets
- It seems that you cheatsheet methods corresponds to **WHAT WORKS WHEN LEARNING LANGUAGES** as a intermediate or advanced learner to **quickly and evenly retain mental sharpness for intended area and tasks**
- It probably doesn't work for beginners for its loss of value of being compact
- Perhaps you should put it into your schedule
- And you should probably develop your personal cheatsheet, *globally* I mean over the years
- There is an amazing aspect about cheatsheet
  - If there is an area of field the knowledge structure of which is almost or entirely identical to one that you know inside-out, you can use cheatsheet as the entry instead of experience.(CTRL+C, CTRL+V tada~)
    - Say you've reached **Spanish C2 level**, you could just use **cheatsheet** to boost your **Portuguese** to reach independent level in the matter of days
    - We could list more scenarios that resemble the above
## Controlled flush of information
- Control the outlet of information input as to serve for intentive purposes
# Strange thinking
- Is there a negative frequency?
