最近几天我觉得自己有点问题, 晚上睡不着, 几本React, 翻译, BABOK可以看一晚上, 第二天照常工作, 也不累。 就看了backlog management, 就是Drip我对于每个work item用onenote记了backlog, 对每个需求进行分解并估点, 然后列出目前老框架升级前后的不同UI组件开发成本, 设计自由度比较和版本更新影响范围

T:
这个很严重了好伐

T:
你先休息下 争取这几天不要看react书

T:
我睡前一个小时从不看书 而且窗边也不放书 看多了会失眠 对身体不好

T:
你不能一直满负荷运转

- This kind of event has happened a few times back in the university, and 5-8 times in the 2 year time span, so how would you prevent this from happening now  and stay professional?
