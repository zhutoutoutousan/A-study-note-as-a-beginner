## Got some serious bacterial infection
- Got some tips for the serious abdominal pain when taking some drugs to counter-effect the high fever: The pain is most likely caused by serious muscle cramp, which pretty much always happens when you have severe bacterial infection. 
- The best way to elleviate this is going to the hospital and tell the doctor that I have that fxxking muscle cramp, because surely I don't have any meds for this.
