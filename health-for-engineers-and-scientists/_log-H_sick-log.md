## Got some serious bacterial infection
- Got some tips for the serious abdominal pain when taking some drugs to counter-effect the high fever: The pain is most likely caused by serious muscle cramp, which pretty much always happens when you have severe bacterial infection. 
- The best way to elleviate this is going to the hospital and tell the doctor that I have that fxxking muscle cramp, because surely I don't have any meds for this.

最近几天我觉得自己有点问题, 晚上睡不着, 几本React, 翻译, BABOK可以看一晚上, 第二天照常工作, 也不累。 就看了backlog management, 就是Drip我对于每个work item用onenote记了backlog, 对每个需求进行分解并估点, 然后列出目前老框架升级前后的不同UI组件开发成本, 设计自由度比较和版本更新影响范围

T:
这个很严重了好伐

T:
你先休息下 争取这几天不要看react书

T:
我睡前一个小时从不看书 而且窗边也不放书 看多了会失眠 对身体不好

T:
你不能一直满负荷运转 

T:
一张一弛 文武之道也

之前正常, 就这两天可以调整过来。 嗯嗯我就不放枕边书了

Do it first#dailyreview
- Clean up your bed before sleeping
- Resolve your mental knots
  - Anxiety, imposter syndrome 40%
    - --> human needs rests
  - Curious and eager to learn 60%
    - --> focus on what matters

Why it is serious
- It may not if you work as freelance, having all the time developing your own projects, but it's the imbalance that is serious
- Projects works on a strict time span, it's better to be predictable to others

After you did it and got everything back to normal, answer this question:
- This kind of event has happened a few times back in the university, and 5-8 times in the 2 year time span, so how would you prevent this from happening now  and stay professional?
