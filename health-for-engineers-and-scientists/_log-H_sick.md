## Got some serious bacterial infection
Got some tips for the serious abdominal pain when taking some drugs to counter-effect the high fever: The pain is most likely caused by serious muscle cramp, which pretty much always happens when you have severe bacterial infection. 
The best way to elleviate this is going to the hospital and tell the doctor that I have that fxxking muscle cramp, because surely I don't have any meds for this.
