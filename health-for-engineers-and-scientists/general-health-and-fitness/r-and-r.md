# Arsenal of R&R
## Sleep
## Meditation
- Hypothesis obtained from observation
  - Meditation can lower RHR?
    - Average RHR: 60BPM --> After meditation: 57BPM
  - There are something subtle about the meditation
    - It seems like there's some aesthetic fatigue going on here, after you are immersed in meditation for a while, you become used to it. Just like caffeine, you are tolerant and it does not work as strong as before and needs some time off to recover, how does this mechanism work and what's its inner structure(neuralscience)
## Exercise
## Travel
## Food
### Diet break
## Gaming

# Case study for future study of the innate working mechanism between manifestation of fatigue and recovery methods
- Why do the case study?
  - Reach optimal recovery speed for efficiency and to maximum progress in a variety of sub-goals of life.
- Case 1
  - Study goal
    - Figure out in what scenarios could meditation be useful
  - Symptom
    - Feeling of soreness, itchyness, tenderness in the head
      - Intensifies when performing new neural pathways
      - Relieves when listening to meditation music
    - History of nerve damage around the lower back(Recovery: 18/20) 
  - Measures
    - Take a short trip within the same city
    - Take some diet break(200 calories below the maintenance number)
    - Listen to meditation music along the way
    - Plan for 1-2 days without rigorous intellectual activities
      - Need to categorize the intellectual activities with repect to their intensities
        - List of rigorous intellectual activities
        - List of moderate intellectual activities
        - List of mild intellectual activities
    - Completely cut off?
  - Monitor
    - Experiment 1
      - Date: 10/1/2020
      - Recovery time: 
      - Diary
        - Day 1
          - Caveat
            - 5g of caffeine taken around 15:00
          - Measure combo used
            - Diet break
            - Meditation music(Time unlimited)
            - Take a walk
              - Meditation music
            - Intellectual activities change
              - Focus on one easy stuff only
            - Consumed chinese anti-virus medication for potentially compromised immune system
              - To counter against the potential viral or bacterial infection
          - Notes
            - Isolate out all stress points
            - Lying in bed, avoiding uncontrollable light source irritation seems to do the trick
            - Videos that triggers mental relaxation seems to be geared towards long narrative driven gameplay
            - Possible increased chance of more recovery if you take a long walk meditating after lying in bed for a while
            - A bike ride with the speed slow enough not to be taxing on any attention on riding or breathing with meditation music on have great effect
              - RHR lowered to 57BPM while average is 60BPM
              - There're signs for repression of negative internal narrative and areas in the brain that shouldn't be too active
              - Feelings of recovery in the brain
        - Day 2
          - Caveat
            - Must work comparatively rigorously to meet the deadline
            - 8g of coffee powder taken around 13:00
          - Recovery state
            - Minor respiritory tract infection
              - Mucus built in lung and trachea
              - Possible compromised immune system due to the accumulated mental fatigue built over days
          - Assess and adjust
            - Keep medication
