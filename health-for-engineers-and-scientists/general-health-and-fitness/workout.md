# Why should engineers and scientists workout at the first place?
## Benefits
- Resistance training
- Cardio
  - Better heart

## Scenarios
- I'm a beginner
  - I just graduates from University and have no money
- I'm a intermediate


 

# HARDER THAN LAST TIME
- No running before getting 82kg, below 15% body fat
- Strength
  - Don't injury yourself as a coder/engineer/scientist, 5-8RM only
  - Squat: 105kg 5RM
  - Deadlift: 150kg 5RM
  - Bench press: 80kg 5RM
  - Overhead Press
- Endurance
  - Unlock after reaching down to 82kg, below 15% body fat
- Power
- Calisthetics
# Debate space
- Losing 1% body fat rate per month is optimal for cutting without losing muscle
- You can't neglect cardio, a healthy heart is crutial for long-term development for engineers and scientists
  - [What's the BEST Cardio to Preserve Muscle???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfXQwutMFA)

# TODO
- Fill in the gaps
  - Dude, seriously, plz fill in the pre-rehersed workout plans for 'I just worked 8 hours and I don't want the workout to reduce my academic/tech performance', 'I don't want to do the compound lift but still want to train these parts, what do you suggest?(It needs to be smark ;p)
- Add more structural integrity overtime

# Posture routine for scientists and engineers
- [The PERFECT Daily Posture Routine (UNDO SITTING!) - ATHLEAN-X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3PZZyoXnKU&t=354s)


# Training paradigm
## Athletic performance
### H.I.I.T
### Tabata
## Hypertrophy
### Super set
### Drop set
### Concentric/Isometric/Eccentric contraction
### Pylometric contraction
# Scientific research on workout
- P.O.I
  - Shredded sports science
  - Jeff Nippard
  - Jeff Cavaliere


## Workout equipment
- Fitness band calory burn is garbage, use standard data instead.
## Injury and and training deviations
- If there's AC joint, labrum tear, then never try any bench press or overhead shoulder press lower than 3RM
## Nutrition
- [Estimating Accuracy at Exercise Intensities: A Comparative Study of Self-Monitoring Heart Rate and Physical Activity Wearable Devices](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374271/)
## Kinesiology
## Muscle growth
## Workout --> Goal relationship
## Recovery
- Recovery time
  - Muscle group specified
  - Injury specified
    - Nerve damage: 6-12 weeks
    - Tendon tear

# Assess and adjust(Long-term)
- If it is short-term you should include a status report on your training plan
## Example(Current status track)
- Ribcage
  - Debuff
    - Intercostal neuralgia
  - Recovery time:
    - Duration: 6-12 weeks
  - Adjustment
    - All lifts reduce to --> 6RM+

- Back
  - Debuff
    - Smaller lats on the left
  - Adjustment
    - Extra reps for left-side lats for each set
- Posterior chain
  - Debuff
    - Injury
      - Nerve damage
      - Muscle damage
    - Unable to perform these lifts:
      - Deadlift
      - Kettle bell swing
      - Hip thrust
    - Reduced weight for these lifts:
      - Squat --> 6RM+
      - Farmer's carry
  - Recovery time
    - Duration: 6-12 weeks
    - Progress: 9/18/2020-11/1/2020
- Shoulder
  - Debuff
    - AC joint pain
    - Labrum tear
    - SLAP
    - Weakness on the left side
  - Reduced weight for these lifts:
    - Bench press --> 6RM+
- Chest
  - Debuff
    - Smaller left lec
  - Adjustment
    - Extra training for the left pec
- Bicep 
  - Debuff
    - Weakness on the right side 
  - Adjustment
    - Extra training for bicep on the right for each set
- Engineer
  - Debuff
    - Beginner level
      - Posture
      - Muscle imbalance
    - Workout performance
      - Diminished resource for neurological strength and time
    - Weak
      - More compromised immune system for regular work stress
      - Stress related disease like intercostal neuralgia etc. 
      - Academic/Tech performance is sensitive to workout injury
        - Injury-induced pain like neuralgia will greatly reduce the neurological effort for intellectual activities, causing wasting mental effort due to not enough neural power to make new connections or formulate patterns
  - Buff
    - Access to scientific-based materials of nutrition and workout
  - Adjustment
    - 5RM to 8RM for strength and hypertrophy, 8RM-10RM for hypertrophy
    - Not recommended for 10RM+ for more training volume
    - 1RM can only be done once every 2-3 months for strength test purposes
    - Warm up needed
- Scientist
  - Buff
    - Access to advanced scientific-based materials of nutrition and workout
