- Random: Maybe you can split virtual desktop to sort by intensity
## The categories of intellectual activity intensity
- Stenuous
  - Characteristics
    - Building brand new, complex, rigorous neural pathway/pattern with no or minimum pre-built assessory background
    - Everything in between with the same level
    - For some field an individual has pre-built facility in, the intellectual capacity demanded surpass the limit of that individual by a large margin by so much that he/she must stay highly focused to reach borderline meaningful results.

    - For an individual who never touched rigorous Mathematics to study computer science
    - For someone who never know how to sing Bel Canto to get the hang of singing
  - Effects on body
- Everything in between
