# \[NEW QUEST\]: QUANTIFY YOUR PATH TO STRENGTH
- You've been training strength, hypertrophy for almost two years, and you have some progress but not optimized, now the power has been decided that you should find a way to quantify your progress so it becomes more controllable and tangible. Do your thing.

# STUPID PROBLEMS
- Muscle discomfort in calves
  - [Creatine, Muscle Cramping and Muscle Tightness](http://www.andersenchiro.com/Creatine,%20Muscle%20Cramping%20and%20Muscle%20Tightness.htm)
  - Consider L-THEANINE + Caffeine Combination as the alternative for Creatine for a month as cold turkey 
    - DO IT AS SOON AS U FINISH PREWORKOUT
    - FIRST, stop taking creatine in the morning
  - MY CASE:
    - After going cold turkey on creatine intake, the sense of tenderness in my left calf has been relieved
