# STUPID PROBLEMS
- Muscle discomfort in calves
  - [Creatine, Muscle Cramping and Muscle Tightness](http://www.andersenchiro.com/Creatine,%20Muscle%20Cramping%20and%20Muscle%20Tightness.htm)
  - Consider L-THEANINE + Caffeine Combination as the alternative for Creatine for a month as cold turkey 
    - DO IT AS SOON AS U FINISH PREWORKOUT
    - FIRST, stop taking creatine in the morning
  - MY CASE:
    - After going cold turkey on creatine intake, the sense of tenderness in my left calf has been relieved
