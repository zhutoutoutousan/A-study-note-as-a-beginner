    - Browsing the mock test book shows you that:
      - You have good command of German vocabulary, your vocabulary size is about 10,000-12,000, which is enough for a higher grade
      - You often listen to German 
      - But you need to do the mock tests and learn as much as you can
    - By the number
      - Every mock test costs you about 3 hours, for your learning style, I can set the hard uplimit to 4 hours
