### You gonna do something about it man
清华大学教授李稻葵就曾在一次演讲中说：

```
不要犹豫，尽早认准大方向。消灭选择，义无反顾，认准长远，认定自己，然后想方设法找到你要奋斗的那个圈子。

跟了那个圈子之后，你会跟着这个圈子不断地往上走。
```

- Innate language skills
- Music background

### Think more actively

- [Active vs. Lazy Thinking](https://alexw.substack.com/p/active-vs-lazy-thinking)
    - How do you identify whether one specific task, activity, project fits the incremental approach or short-term transformational approach?
### Communicate in an effective way
- [Information Compression](https://alexw.substack.com/p/information-compression)

### Minimize time leak & Balance between statics and dynamics
- Constantly group your activities and projects together to optimize progression
- If 90% of the tasks in a field is similar, shutdown filtering mechanism and get immersed in that environment till it saturates; Do the dogfeeding at the end in case something is missed
### The effect of R&R in other places
- The chance of integrate the subliminal knowledge and skills intake with the core
- Replenished energy to think and implement matters in a drastically different way
