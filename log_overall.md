# Customized motivation pool
清华大学教授李稻葵就曾在一次演讲中说：
```
不要犹豫，尽早认准大方向。消灭选择，义无反顾，认准长远，认定自己，然后想方设法找到你要奋斗的那个圈子。

跟了那个圈子之后，你会跟着这个圈子不断地往上走。
```

# Idea pool
## Study system
- Idea: Taking the table of contents as tree input, which contains the relations, you input your goal, it recommends your learning order with respect to your memory and skills decay
- Back in to the track * 1

## Global strategy dashboard

# Caveats
- Search '!BEFORE YOU END YOUR DAY!' when reflecting on yourself at the end of the day for self-integration and idea extraction


# Behavior
## `_encoded-habit`
*Any enforcing habit that has exceeded 21-day streak will be moved here and is no longer in a enforced state*
## `_enforcing-habit` 4/5
- Orderly 1/21
  - Before you go on your day, pre-vision your activities with attention to time, quality, and  & Immersive style 0/21
    - Time estimation and non-exhaustive feedback
  - Flow adjustment and reflection only happens before sleep or during R&R 1/21
- Up-to-date
  - Spend at least 30 minutes to catch up with the world every day 1/21
- Agility 0/21
  - Keep an eye on those ways to achieve trade-off between plan concentration and agility
- Problem solver 0/40
## `_discarded-habit` 0/_
- Same as above
## `_discarding-habit` 2/5
- Easy to be distracted 0/21
  - Rewire your brain
    - Visualize your current task queue and permitted interrupts
    - Block unwanted interrupts

### Think more actively

- [Active vs. Lazy Thinking](https://alexw.substack.com/p/active-vs-lazy-thinking)
    - How do you identify whether one specific task, activity, project fits the incremental approach or short-term transformational approach?
### Communicate in an effective way
- [Information Compression](https://alexw.substack.com/p/information-compression)

### Minimize time leak & Balance between statics and dynamics
- Constantly group your activities and projects together to optimize progression
- If 90% of the tasks in a field is similar, shutdown filtering mechanism and get immersed in that environment till it saturates; Do the dogfeeding at the end in case something is missed
### The effect of R&R in other places
- The chance of integrate the subliminal knowledge and skills intake with the core
- Replenished energy to think and implement matters in a drastically different way


## **Accurate** time chunk allocation data based on self-tested conclusions to reach optimal outcome
- Software
  - Leetcode
    - Easy
    - Medium
    - Hard
      - 2 Hours using Python
        - Implementation takes longest time
  - Coding project
    - At least 3 hours
- Language
  - Load pack: GE 110words, FR 100words, SP 100words: 2-3 hours(When doing other stuffs)

## Creating an efficient, low-mental friction context switch map of strategy
- Overview
  - So, its seems never possible to mimick a complete highly-focused timechunk for uni-lateral or bi-lateral hustles because you have multiple hustles on-going.
  - It's a good chance to train your context switch strategy with heavy loads
- Generic tools
  - Binaural beats with music
    - Alpha
    - Gamma
      - Relieving headache for reducing overthinking and boosts concentration
      - Risk of missing outside information
      - Ability to work 4hrs+ straight
      - Cancel energy leak
  - **You need more than binaural beats to make a sustainable flow esay**

      - e.g. So ur installing something that might take 30min, 1hr, 5hrs to implement or download due to some reasons, what's the best thing to do?
