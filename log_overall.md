# Coping with self-dysregulation
**PROBLEM**:It seems that you're constantly suffering from self-dysregulation and in the mean time paying the price for the consequences of twisted or degraded social performance, let's set up a workbench and deal with this issue
- Study the problem
  - [Emotional dysregulation in adults: The influence of rumination and negative secondary appraisals of emotion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720332845)
  - [What Is Emotional Dysregulation?](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-emotional-dysregulation)
    - Emotional dysregulation is a term used to describe an emotional response that is poorly regulated and does not fall within the traditionally accepted range of emotional reaction


# Potential destructive elements scope
- When I started to overcome myself, challenge myself into doing a bit more or resisting my original inertia, I started to feel physically stressed.
  - I may utilize my medical acumen against changing myself
# Customized motivation pool
清华大学教授李稻葵就曾在一次演讲中说：
```
不要犹豫，尽早认准大方向。消灭选择，义无反顾，认准长远，认定自己，然后想方设法找到你要奋斗的那个圈子。

跟了那个圈子之后，你会跟着这个圈子不断地往上走。
```

人们常觉得准备的阶段是在浪费时间，只有当真正机会来临，而自己没有能力把握的时候，才能觉悟自己平时没有准备才是浪费了时间。 ——罗曼.罗兰

有所成就的人，都有一个共性，就是逻辑 - Ray Dalio

情商和智商缺了哪个都会被随时出局。但这并不代表你要改变自己去一味迎合别人的文化和口味，只要能找到自己的USP（Unique selling proposition），始终带着一颗谦卑和真诚的心，相信到哪里运气都不会太差。 - Whoever

只是大脑工作的话，你不会感到疲劳，你之所以疲劳是因为你思考遇到难点时沮丧的心理和所做的那些动作，比如皱眉，用手摸头等造成的 - Whoever

# Behavior
- 2021-8-28: This is good, what works should stick
- 2021/8/19: The habit stuff is very good, but if you're working hard and outside your comfort zone, you don't have the energy for that, how do you solve this problem?
  - Good idea, but after some time of osmosis, i tink it shouldn't be a problem
- NEW: Your 21-day habit-forming plan, the 21 doesn't represent 1 day, but a vague sense of momentum. Don't be too pedantic *by your intuition*
## `_encoded-habit`
*Any enforcing habit that has exceeded 21-day streak will be moved here and is no longer in a enforced state*
## `_enforcing-habit` 4/5
- Tranced 4/21
  - Start your day with enough nootropics and one gamma and alpha binaural beat session - According to your knowledge, it has longer effect than you originally think
- Orderly 7/21
  - Before you go on your day, pre-vision your activities with attention to time, quality, and  & Immersive style 3/21
    - Time estimation and non-exhaustive feedback
  - Flow adjustment and reflection only happens before sleep or during R&R 1/21
- Up-to-date 4/21
  - Spend at least 30 minutes to catch up with the world every day 3/21
  - \[STATUS\]: Getting better with the reinforcement of simultaneous translation training
- Agility 2/21
  - Keep an eye on those ways to achieve trade-off between **plan concentration and agility*
- Problem solver 3/40
## `_discarded-habit` 0/_
- Same as above
## `_discarding-habit` 2/5
- Easy to be distracted 6/21
  - Rewire your brain
    - Visualize your current task queue and permitted interrupts
    - Block unwanted interrupts
    - If there emerges interrupts you don't know, group it
  - Dispell distraction source without being cut off
    - LinkedIn Pop-ups
- Messy workplace 4/21
  - Unstructured Work Email 1/1 SOLVED --> ANOTHER PROBLEM
  - Unstructured learning strategy 5/100

### Think more actively

- [Active vs. Lazy Thinking](https://alexw.substack.com/p/active-vs-lazy-thinking)
    - How do you identify whether one specific task, activity, project fits the incremental approach or short-term transformational approach?
### Communicate in an effective way
- [Information Compression](https://alexw.substack.com/p/information-compression)

### Minimize time leak & Balance between statics and dynamics
- Constantly group your activities and projects together to optimize progression
- If 90% of the tasks in a field is similar, shutdown filtering mechanism and get immersed in that environment till it saturates; Do the dogfeeding at the end in case something is missed
### The effect of R&R in other places
- The chance of integrate the subliminal knowledge and skills intake with the core
- Replenished energy to think and implement matters in a drastically different way

## Creating an efficient, low-mental friction context switch mapping strategy
- Overview
  - So, its seems never possible to mimick a complete highly-focused timechunk for uni-lateral or bi-lateral hustles because you have multiple hustles on-going.
  - It's a good chance to train your context switch strategy with heavy loads
- Generic tools
  - Binaural beats with music
    - Alpha
    - Gamma
      - Relieving headache for reducing overthinking and boosts concentration
      - Risk of missing outside information
      - Ability to work 4hrs+ straight
      - Cancel energy leak
  - **You need more than binaural beats to make a sustainable flow esay**

    - Installation
      - e.g. So ur installing something that might take 30min, 1hr, 5hrs to implement or download due to some reasons, what's the best thing to do?
        - Troubleshoot & Optimization(Out of scope)
          - Wait
            - Short wait(5min-15min) - Something it's better to *waste* time than keep yourself busy just for the sake of it
              - So if you wait, you'll get bored and restore your creativity(BETTER THIS WAY)
              - If you switch to another task, you cost 2 more energy expenditure of context switches(NG)
                - If it's pretty much the same job that requires the same area of knowledge, you can proceed with caution
            - Longer wait()
              - Schedule it, and 
  - Social media
    - \[Strategy\]Pre-group it
  - Physical discomfort
    - OMG, my liver has pain
    - OMG, my heart doesn't feel well! I'm gonna die if I don't take a rest!
    - OMG! I have back pain!
    - OMG! My bowel isn't doing me a favor!
  - Mental discomfort
    - OMG! I just got triggered by a gossip!
    - OMG! I just got chewed upon at workplace!
  - Plan dysfunction
    - OMG, I forgot something to put on my schedule!
    - OMG, I forgot to eat my lunch!
    - OMG, I forgot to eat my dinner, if not, my HP would drop!  
    - Ohh, something IMPORTANT comes up clashing all my schedule, Imma about to spend another day wasted for nothing but still can somehow manage to cheat myself feeling fulfilled
  - Information & Event attraction
    - OMG, this knowledge is so sexy! I want to pursue this lead!
    - How about taking a walk?
    - Ohhh, a really interesting french movie, and French is my gig, how about watch it NOW!
  - Self-dysregulation
    - OMG, my life is doing pretty bad!
    - OMG, some random John/Jane Doe is doing better than I am
    - OMG, I'm losing my man cards recently
    - Existential crysis :)

## A new way to organize yourself as a nerd with most agility and focusness
#emerginghabit#lifechanger
- Fill your calendar with items within that time frame as a reference for decision making, then use your brain when implementing.
  - JBP: I probably planning every minute
  - This will activate your dynamic planning pathway instead of imprisoning yourself with deadlines and immutable time chunk. You will be constantly evaluating the situation and making changes as you see fit but with a clear vision of the current situation and what to do
