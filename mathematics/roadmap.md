# What do you want to achieve using mathematics?
- Don't fail APS test without a fight!!! xD
- Must come in handy when it comes to neuroengineering, EE and AI
- Seriously, I found myself slightly interested in Mathematics itself.
# What else can you do once you reach [insert level] level of [insert field] in mathematics?

# Problem solving procedures
- Identify which part of mathematics does the problem involve.
- Go to the involved section and enter problem-solving markdown file
- Find related solutions(Could just contain a portal---A single section for books related with lists, only reference it in each problems--- for the sake of brevity)

# A general grasp of **What you can do** after learning [insert subject] in the oceans of Mathematics
## Calculus
- Find the relationship between **speed**, **travel distance**, **acceleration** and more 
## Category theory
- I just got intimidated by the pedantic concept of **map**, I want to know what the fuss is about(Is it of any use seriously?). --- When I really got all the time and the world.
