### Linear algebra
- Linear algebra is a fairly extensive subject that covers vectors and matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations, eigenvalue problems, and other topics.
- It can be applied to engineering, physics, geometry, computer science, economics, and other areas. It also helps us have a deeper understanding of mathematics itself.
### Linear system
- Some concepts like **unknowns** e.g. $x_1,x_2$ in the following examples. Some **coefficient matrix**, called $\bold{A}$ by listing the coefficients of the **unknowns** in the position in which they appear in the linear equations. As shown in $\tilde{A}$ equation, by augmenting $\bold{A}$ with the right sides of the linear system and call it the augmented matrix of the system.


$$
\bold{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 6 & 9\\
6 & 0 & -2\\
5 & -8 & 1
\end{bmatrix},

\tilde{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 6 & 9 & 6\\
6 & 0 & -2 & 20\\
5 & -8 & 1 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Some examples of linear systems
  - $$
    \begin{matrix}
      4x_1 + 6x_2 + 9x_3 = 6 \\
      6x_1  - 2x_3 = 20 \\
      5x_1 - 8x_2 + x_3 = 10
    \end{matrix}
    $$
