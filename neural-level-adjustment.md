# Introduction
- This section is designed for you to store the neural pattern, capacity that you want to to strengthen using customized training that you designed for yourself to increase your performance the next time you perform that intellectual task.
  - 2021/9/12: Now there seems more to it
- You should describe as in detail as possible what new neural pattern you have formed to make a certain intellectual task more efficient for active retrieval.
- You should link those trainings to specific academic or engineering performance, and monitor the before-after results to see whether the game you designed works or not


# Random observation
- If you read stuffs, and you create a picture attached to it, you will consume more energy but obtain more agility.
  - 2021-9-12: links to experience of legendary conference interpretors


# Current structure for intelligence training
- Require more academic reading for human intelligence for structural improvement
## Quantitative intelligence
### Visual aids
## Verbal intelligence
- P.O.I
  - Jordan B. Peterson
  - Ben Shapiro
### Agility
### Mental Capacity
### Vocabulary span
#### Visualized logic relationship
## Spatial intelligence

2021/4/5 did some stupid research

- [Strengthening spatial reasoning: elucidating the attentional and neural mechanisms associated with mental rotation skill development](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-00211-y)
  - Process 1
    - Goal: Just have a vague sense of training spatial intelligence
    - Subprocess
      - [Oculomotor nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculomotor_nerve#:~:text=The%20oculomotor%20nerve%20is%20the,and%20that%20raise%20the%20eyelid.)
      - z-score
        - [Standard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)
          - [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
          - [Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean#Population_and_sample_means)

#### Clarity
#### Capacity
#### Agility





# Workouts and trainings
## Workout plans
- 10/13/2020
  - Data structure visualization training
## Training
- Data structure visualization training
  - Goal:
  - Use case scenario
  - Exercise:
    - Write down a tree of $N$ depth, each contains a piece of code. Try to remember it as fast as you can
    - Advanced: Try to visualize how it runs with clarity


# Nootropics
I've got a few at my side for daily consumption
- L-Theanine 茶氨酸
  - Maybe have soothing effect
  - Countereffects the anxiety induced by caffeine
  - 1 Capsule per day, taken in the morning
- Citicoline 胞磷胆碱
- 乙酰左旋肉碱
- Creatine + Taurine
- Rhodiola 红景天提取物
- Caffeine
- 菊粉
- Ginko extract
- Tumeric culcumin


I know somethin' else natural that may work
- 婆罗米提取物

- Heightened mental state
  - Usage: Fast reading
  - Signs: You can feel that your brain is concentrating and demands more oxygen
  - Affects
    - BUFF: It may disregard the effect of the context switch
    - REQ: Requires hightened motive flow
    - 
  - Risk
    - *Work hard, play harder*: Increased craving level of dopamine
      - Effect: Increase state momentum and craving over time, if the momentum is obstructed, lose all of your resolve and apply *burnout*
      - PENDING MITIGATION: Establish a dopamine release pathway that has lower future risks
        - Timely vacation would give you enough time to adjust
    - Risk of burnout if the energy flow or motive flow flatline
    - New self-dysregulation pathway
      - Types gallery
        - *Self fact-shaming*: *Look at you, all that effort in vain*; 
        - *Fluster*: *Look at you,just admit that you have low IQ already*; 
        - *Fluster with savageness* *Look at you, just admit that you are dumb already*; 
        - *Quip*: *战术上勤奋, 战略上懒惰*; 
        - *Prophecy*: *The likes of you will never move up*
        - *Cthulhu*: *Well...*
        - *Shame by comparison*: *Look at you, all that effort and you're still not earning billions*; 
          - Wording pathway: *Consumerism*, *Nagging*, *Shame by unilateral comparison*, *Zero-sum thinking*
        - *Existential internalization*: *Come on, you will starve in the street*
          - Searching for crisis logic subconsciously, if none, this self-dysregulation attempt will fail. If so, await for a trigger for outbreak, lose resolve if triggered
        - *External fact-shaming*: *Just think about the Cthulhu*
        - *Envy*: *He's/She's doing everything better than I am!*
        - *Self-doubt*: *Why all that effort? Thoses geniuses already had a way start*
        - *Over-independant*: *Don't ask for help, I can handle it*
        - *Baffled*: *Thinking too much? Just take the negativity and manifest it in the real world to end yourself already!*
  - Fast retain pathway(High mental-effort threshold activities with instant feedback)
    - Mock interpretation 
  - Self-rapport and motivations

- How to locate your functions of the area in your brain where you have pain, experiment it with only using that part of the brain function area without the ache to get more feedback
