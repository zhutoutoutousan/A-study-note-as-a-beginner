# A
## Action potential(Spike)
## Aliasing

# D
## Discrete-time signal processing
- *Discrete-time signal processing* includes digital signal processing as a special case, but also includes the possibility that sequences of samples(sampled data) are processed with other discrete-time technologies.

# M
## Morse code
- **Morse code** is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called *dots* and *dashes*.
