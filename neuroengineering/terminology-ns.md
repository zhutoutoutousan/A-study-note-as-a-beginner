# A
## Axon
### Myelinated axon
- Information is transferred faster at a rate of 2-120m/s, with an average time of 12-750ms.
### Naked axon
- Information is transferred slower at a rate of 0.2-1.0m/s, with an average time of 1.5-7s.

# C
## Cell assembly
## CNS
Centeral nervous system

# G
## Glia
- Supporters of neurons
### Astrocytes
- Comprise about 20% of the glia cells
- Cleaning up the wastes like excess ions, excess neuro-transmitters and their metabolites. 
- Mobilize the neuron.
- The synapses are enveloped in the processes of Astrocytes.
### Oligodendrocytes
- Produce myelin in CNS
- Comprise 75% of the central glia cells
### Schwann cells
### Microglia
- A hot topic
- Comprise 5% of the glia cells
- Immune cells invaded into the nervous system
- Related to Alzheimer's disease and other chronic brain diseases.
### Trivia
- Produce myelin in PNS
- According to Suzana Herculane Hovzel, a human brain generally contains about 86 billion neurons and 85 billion glia with a ratio of 0.99.

# L
## Lymphatic vessels

# M
## Myelin
Myelin is a fatty wrap that goes around some axons.
