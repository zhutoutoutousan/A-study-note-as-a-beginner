## Sort by aspirations
- *Because of physical laws, larger storage devices are slower than smaller storage devices. And faster devices are more expensive to build than their slower counterparts. For example, the disk drive  ona typical system might be 1000 times larger than the main memory, but it might take the processor 10,000,000 times longer to read a word from disk than from memory*
- *...a typical register file stores only a few hundred bytes of information, as opposed to billions of bytes in the main memory. However, the processor can read data from the register file almost 100 times faster than from memory. Even more troublesome, as semiconductor technology progresses over the years, this **processor-memory gap** continues to increase. It is easier and cheaper to make processors run faster than it is to make main memory run faster.*
