## Current hypothesis on IQ
- Neural efficiency theory
  - Perceived IQ difference may resides in pre-built highly efficient network for performing socially accepted highly intelligent tasks
  - This could affect your attitude and needs towards notetaking as *interpretation* and rigorous verbal reasoning are being integrated into your future career
    - Note can be messy, but it must serve as a well-structured information highway with maximum throughput and minimum styling
      - Timely Brain-note engagements are also important
        - You should fill the gaps between pillars, without doing so, your note will gradually become useless
  - 学习过程
    - 探查过程
      - 探查哪种神经刺激通路能够满足以下要求
        - 高效
          - 消耗最低脑力
          - 效率最高-->#
        - 直达**目标表现**
    - 录入过程
      - 短期记忆
        - 适合灵活场景
        - 对短期记忆技巧与积累有要求
          - pre-built general-purpose knowledge structure
          - pre-built delicated fully or mostly compatible knowledge structure
      - 笔记
    - 增强过程
      - Note-Brain engagement
    - 表现过程
      - Unite and reinforce
    - 实时反馈 & 循环
