    - _comments
      - **VALUABLE DATA POINT** Interesting subject matter with psychological research value for personality, identity disorder
      - **IRREVERSABLE** Mind on the verge of breakdown on daily basis, mentally unstable
      - **VULNERABLE** Suspectible to group psychological effect, needs a cause for self-justification for amnesia effect on personal failure and re-occuring abusive, sadistic behaviour 
      - **IRREVERSABLE** Unbelievably high level of social dominance orientation in tandem with extreme level of disonnance between current social class, mobility, and expected spectrum, which cause bi-polar disorder
        - **RIGID** Constantly consuming the most convenient way possible to achieve  without thinking about the consequence
        - **RIGID** Actively and blindly gathering aggressive, abusive working pathway, including euphemism, dysphemism using limited intellectual sophistication and capacity, will use voice and primitive manipulation for the subject's own temperary mental capacity
      - **IRREVERSABLE** Abusive, aggressive, crafty, actively seeking out a venting pathway for the subject matter's inquenchable vulnerable narcissistic personality with illusional grandiose picture
      - **DANGEROUS, DESTRUCTIVE, NIHILISTIC** Actively seeking out psychological vulnerabilities of others and treat them as if they were the assets for future penetration testing

      - **UNPROFESSIONAL**
      - **DISHONEST**
      - **RESTRICTION** Can only be put in repetitive work with group psychological healing environment, without imposing sense of social economic dissonance
        - Manual worker, social worker, cashier, clerk
      - **DANGEROUS, PSYCHOTIC** Subject matter is sensitive to *stakeholder-engagement-plan*, *resource-management-plan*-like conversation and will not hesitate to whistleblow, or cause uninformed internal relationship problems in a tacit way taking the advantage of information flow manipulation for **sport**
      - **DANGEROUS** Opportunistic, *Gone with Consumerism*, self-destructive
