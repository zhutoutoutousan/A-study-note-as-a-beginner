## Can you explain to me the psychological pathway of you speaking like that

I....usually find lazy worm ... pudding-ish, or egg-tart-ish like whiirrrlpoool

I actually peceived the level of smoothness and softness of XXX's cheek a while ago, and I was thinking about coming up with a quantitative model to describe it...

## Concerning your so-called gaymification
- I think you're not actually transforming into a gay, it's just a part of you is trying to gain some paternal support and guidance that throughout your life you never ever had. It is sad to be born into a family where no emotional support or career guidance is present and on the contrary, they actually needs emotional support for their own tragedies while slowing everybody else down as if it is the like it should be. But this is a test for your resolve, a test for you to overcome such great, inappreciated, impossible-to-overcome challenges.
- Strive and thrive, there's no immediate medicine for this, you might just act strange in front of some males whom you think would fill some of your thirst for a paternal figure while not jeopardizing your own career pathway, but, passing a certain threshold, like you're successful, you've found your path, you achieved F.I.R.E. All of those will wash off after a few years' concentration, improvement, and hard work.
