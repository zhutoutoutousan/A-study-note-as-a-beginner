## Can you explain to me the psychological pathway of you speaking like that
```
I....usually find lazy worm ... pudding-ish, or egg-tart-ish like whiirrrlpoool

I actually peceived the level of smoothness and softness of XXX's cheek a while ago, and I was thinking about coming up with a quantitative model to describe it...

## Concerning your so-called gaymification
- I think you're not actually transforming into a gay, it's just a part of you is trying to gain some paternal support and guidance --- *a sense of cathartic feeling of being guided by a father of wisdom and power*, or a twisted version that can partially satisfy this --- that throughout your life you never ever had. It is sad to be born into a family where no emotional support or career guidance is present and on the contrary, they actually needs emotional support for their own tragedies while slowing everybody else down as if it is the the way it should be. But this is a test for your resolve, a test for you to overcome such great, inappreciated, impossible-to-overcome challenges.
- Strive and thrive, there's no immediate medicine for this, you might just act strange in front of some males whom you think would fill some of your thirst for a paternal figure while not jeopardizing your own career pathway(*At least you are not that stupid*), but, passing a certain threshold, like you're successful, you've found your path, you achieved F.I.R.E. All of those will wash off after a few years' concentration, improvement, and hard work.
- Keep your eyes on the prize, keep talking to others even with the risk of showing your personal ... *quirk*. I know you can keep that at bay.

If your family is dragging you down and overpricing their contribution, which it happens right now like leeches on your skin with a bit of moral highground. During the process of gaining a proper stance, you need to salvage what really matters in the later stage of your life.

## Dopamine gradient pathway log to create a personal 4-D pathway map for efficient and timely pathway stimulation
#emergingidea
### Collecting data
```json
{
    _id: '1',
    time: "2021-8-28-22-15",
    path: [
        [
            'music_jazz',
            'music_binaural',
            'work_low-impact-translation'
        ]
    ],
    context: {
        // ?
    }
}

```

### Collecting communication
```
PF:
the context is actually used to serve as training data

i:
Oh yes

PF:
like, mental status, a snapshot of overall description

PF:
so you input a context, like {energy: 9, someComplexDescriptionForNLP: 'I had a rough day at work, and I have 2 tests ahead...' //...}

PF:
Then it will give you a dopamine pathway: {1: 'Do this', 2: 'Do that later', 3: 'Do it for 30 minutes' //...}

PF:
Which will maximize the integral of dopamine, seretonin, or whatchamacallit during this timeframe
