# Social conformity
## Group pressure test
- TSA: P36 - Figure 3.1 and -P37
  - *...Two alternatives were open to the subject: he could act independently, repudiating the majority, or he could go along with the majority,  repudiating the evidence of his senses. Of the 123 put to the test, a considerable percentage yielded to the majority. Whereas in ordinary circumstances individuals matching the lines will make mistakes less than 1 percent of the time, under group pressure the minority subjects swung to acceptance of the misleading majority's wrong judgements in 36.8 percent of the selections. ...The performances of individuals in this experiment tend to be highly consistant*
