# The big question

Why do we study the history of psychology?

## 75% of the population is universally unaware

According to \[[A history of modern psychology - Chapter 1 P23](../pdf/A-history-of-modern-psychology.pdf)\], in a experiment sampling 151 students at Western Washington University asking whether they have noticed the clown on a unicycle passing by them, the results shows only 25% of the students were aware of the clown. The book suggest that: 'We may find it difficult, if not possible, to pay attension to more than one stimulus at a time. In other words, it is really hard to focus on more than one thing.' That is to say, you might be learning the history of psychology from time to time without even knowing it, maybe from the propaganda, or the daily life, but are you truly paying attention to what really happend, what really reveals the truth and the inner machinism of the phenomenon, what really brings you the insight to guide you and others through the maze of life? This leads to the question: 'Why am I studying the history of psychology?'.
