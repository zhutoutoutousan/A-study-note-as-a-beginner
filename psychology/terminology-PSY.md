# Alphabetical
## A
### Aion
### Allegory

### Altruism
- the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others.
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism)
### âme
- (French) (n.f)灵魂
  - 首领，中心人物
### Apposite
### Archetype
- ...*they constitute the personal and private side of psychic life. The contents of the collective unconscious, on the other hand, are known as archetypes*...
    - [p22](https://www.are.na/block/1493356)
- ...*One must, for the sake of accuracy, dinstinguish between "archetype" and "archetypal ideas". The archetype as such is a hypothetical and irrepresentable model, something like the "pattern of behaviour" in biology.* --- Cf. "One the nature of the Psyche," sec.7
### Ascribe
### Assent
### Astrology
- Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects.

## C
### Capable of consciousness
- (Jung)...*Psychic existence can be recognized only by the presence of contents that are capable of consciousness. We can therefore speak of an unconscious only in so far as we are able to demonstrate its contents. The contents of the personal unconscious are chiefly the feeling-toned complexes, as they are called*...
    - [P22](https://www.are.na/block/1493356)
### Collective unconscious
- ...*But this personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal experience and is not a personal acquisition but is inborn. This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious. I have chosen the term 'collective' because this part of the unconscious is not individual but universal; in constrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behaviour that are more or less the same everywhere and in all individuals. It is, in other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes a common psychic substrate of a suprapersonal nature which is present in every one of us*...
