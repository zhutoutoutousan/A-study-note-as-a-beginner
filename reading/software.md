# Programming language proficiency
Dude, is it really a good idea to learn a programming language through piles of books? 
## C
- Motivation
  - I coded in C before and got a taste first-hand
  - I want to be a better programmer
- Learn C the HARD WAY
  - [link1](https://users.elis.ugent.be/~jrvdnbro/learn_c_the_hard_way.pdf)
  - Goals
    - Learn about *rigorous defensive programming*
  - Interesting points:
    - *C is broken, It is full of design choirces that made sense in the 1970s but make zero sense now. ... it's the most difficult language to write securely.*
      - unrestricted, wild use of pointers 
      - severely broken NUL terminated strings
  - Process 1:(Learn when you have some spare time and interest)
    - Progress: 19/660
- C book
  - [link1](https://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/)
## C++
- Motivation:
  - Chromium V8 is written in C++, how come you don't have any familiarity with it?
  - [chromium - JavaScript deep dive](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/)
- C++ Primer
  - [link1 - Requires download](https://faculty.psau.edu.sa/filedownload/doc-8-pdf-95bf5763251f491480a0c1e5b76a16d8-original.pdf)
## JavaScript
- Motivations
  - Currently no need for motivations 
  - [The Best Programming Language To Learn In 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7-YFU5GpX4&t=25s)
## Java
- Motivations:
  - Practice data structrure on Hackerrank videos
- Learning Java by Niemeyer Patrick and Leuck Danial: 66/1010
  - [Link1](http://ikucukkoc.baun.edu.tr/lectures/EMM3115/Learning_Java.pdf)
    - Pretty slow to load
  - Process 1:
    - Goals
      - Getting to know the basic syntax
      - Follow along the programming environment setting
    - SKIMMED: 43-54
      - The features of Java, recommended start reading after having worked with Java for some time
    - Follow along 64- 
      - This phase should be pleasant and fast
