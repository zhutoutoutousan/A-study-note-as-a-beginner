Good, another quietly crazy month

# 2021/11/4- Flow state
Flow state, during flow state, overall status log is bascially impossible if the momentum is to be kept

# *The world hits yet another cosmos-negligible entity ferosciously in one of the stupidest way to the public eye, eliminating all the escape pathway from the Medusa, the stone eyes, running the evergoing search algorithm for vulnerability with that --- benevolous gaze*
- A new combo of challenge?
  - Pinched nerve
  - CATTI
  - Translation exercise
  - More diversification of study item and re-arrangement required
- Real challenge, or false challenge?
  - Verdict: It's a false challenge
  - Source: The dysfunctional mental energy build-up is approaching its threshold
- Problem shifted: How to let off *steam* in the most efficient way available?
  - Top priority
    - Nerve pain --> Sleep
    - CATTI unreadiness
      - Mental shift and solidification: Failing is totally acceptable
    - Overall plan adaptation
      - Arrange workload and ordering
    - Quick reflection on the current state
  - Second priority
    - Dysfunctional mental sectors
      - Sense of weakness
      - Self-dyshumanization(Only the part that is in the way of efficiency)
    - Concentrated inter-human interaction with minimal effort of low ROI
  - Third priority
    - No existential problems a.k.a forced mate in sight
- Action
  - Sleep it off
    - Nerve pain
    - Sleep deprivation
  - Show up in CATTI with the purpose of logging the biological state descriptors of stoicism
    - Clear out false existential fear
  - Rigorous planning and ordering emminent
    - Solidify future existential progression

# On the countermeasure of your highly functional `yet no show` matter
- So, can you develop a system that can keep the storyline in check by showing up in a test the required physical movement in a city of which is considered highly tedious and full of grunt work?
  - Powering through is very good, but not so important
- Context
  - *OCD*: If a certain value chain include commuting, talking to a group of people on trivial matters without getting things done(*Or you enjoy being a buzzkill by bringing up some random deep sxxt that hurts people deep down inside without any feeling of backfire --- Or you don't care, as usual*), doing repetitive work without building a system to automate it, your efficiency will get hammered because you will simply not do it or do it with constant self-dysregulation management
  - *OMG, why should I leave my house, travel for hours, meet lots of human beings just to take a stupid test that only serves one of the many pieces in a giant chessboard of life* **while so many things can be done efficiently and energy-leak-free from the safety of a room**
  - *Non-stop thinking and learning, leaving no engineering reserve*: The moment you discover that your brain becomes idle, you start searching another work item in your brain to fill it up
- Action
  - Strategic
    - There will be a radical change towards your accreditation strategy
      - **Remote comes first**
        - All of those weakly-career-related tests sourcing process should only be focused on REMOTE
  - Existential
    - CATTI
      - You can spend a few money like lottery, if it happens that on the test day, you accidentally are able to get up before 9AM and don't need to apply for some stupid medical examination issued overnight


- Positivity through powering through

# How to get up and show up in some must-attend-onsite activities when you're getting back to the nocturnal state
- According to your history of performance, the normal ON state for you is between: 3:00PM~5:00AM(The next day)
- And due to your innate oblivion and numbness to any type of OMG-I-MISSED-THAT-PARTY, additional procedures need to be taken to prevent **no-show**

# How to flip the nocturnal state
- This action cannot be achieved at this time
- 2021/11/23: It depends

# 2021/11/23
## Upcoming challenges
- Sleep deprivation ends, AWS section should be transformed to 

- \[ALARM\]好奇心管理机制和研究欲管理机制长期处于超负荷状态, 影响正常工作输出, 现有负荷估计为26000%
  - There is currently no solution available
  - Upgrading Curiosity management and Research management is mandatory, if the exposure goes up exponentially, paralysis will ensue
  - WHY THIS IS SERIOUS
    - A project is time-sensitive, you should evaluate its impact
  - Solution
    - **Plan for vacation during which all of the intellectual activities shall stop**
    - **Socialize with people during this timeframe**
    - **Play music, canta il bel canto**
    - GET WELL-STAGED SLEEP
    - **Travel therapy** --> *Go somewhere far far away*
      - Require self-planning to ensure the therapeutic effect without unexpected negative effect
    - **Music therapy**
      - The last time I tried, it always comes that some methods have reduced effect over time, and if I revisit it again, it will chronically and permanently have that effect ---> Create `therapy` section in `Art & Media` folder
    - Get a puppy
      - INTJ & INTP: Not applicable
    - Get a companion
      - Current Insane status: Not applicable by significant margin

## **Health check**
- Please get your health check date settled with upmost attention
- Log to `sicklog` for furthur integration
