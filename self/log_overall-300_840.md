## It seems like you are falling short of elastic planning of one day on the fly
- Define problem
  - 2021/12/1: Ok, I get it, the main contact point of sources of chaos is the daily meeting, which requires lots of changes
    - I like challenges of changes, VUCA agility is a must skill
- Find a solution

### Sifting through the time-based rigidity and task-based rigidity and your `I'm sleep deprived and sleep only 3 hours a day with crazy schedules and insane activities yet I'm workaholic so I have no intention to change it` situation

### Self-generated data attempt
- google sheet
  - 建立一个通用的开发任务的项目导向数据库
    - 什么功能
    - VUGA的灵活性
    - 时间
    - 沟通
    - 资源
    - ...
  - 比如说, 特定的开发任务, 开始自我记录, 然后定义一个记录点, 在sheet里边将特定的开发任务
### Intellectual effort: Adjust in your head when sleep-deprived

## I want every notification you perform actions to see to be useful and valuable

## EMERGENCY: Sort out all the workspaces regarding PS, BS_eng, and BS_int
- Report back to this sector with re-organized and efficient structure of its management

  - You actually gain power and motivation on perceiving negative feedback, both implicit and explicit
  - During this excited state, you actually get more done than before

## On your off-the-charts curiosity and research desire
- Ok, I give it up, just let it ramp up, you don't have the desire of *having a life* after all
