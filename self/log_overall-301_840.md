- I'm going to live the next 539 months of my life with this
  - You're rather a strange man, even one single minute you're going to make it count
  - If the level of sophistication of every second you spend is lower than your standard, which is insanely high, then you will feel the pain, sometimes even physically
  - Every time you speak with another human, if the level of sophistication is lower than the threshold, you will feel extreme pain in your abdomen, every sentence is a great effort
  - Your act of extrovert is actually based on crafty effort and only available when you are in a state of high energy and have the clear vision of its ROI and the ability to make a difference
- What should I do?
  - I'm going to live the next 539 months of my life with this

I will fulfill my purpose.*

# Handling with clients who don't know exactly what they want
*客户购买产品的目的都是为了帮助自己解决问题，但是很多时候客户连自己都不太清楚他所临的问题。当他自己都需求不明确的时候，他只能想出一些不成熟的东西，却指望产品赶出一个demo看看样子。但是就这样成功的概率很低，所以会导致一遍一遍地改动需求，一直重复这个过程。*

- On the edge, covered by snow, it feels like as if the water in the air has grown to the size of Dandelion floating around. The sky is glooming gray and bland. Looking down, I see a giant whirlpool the size of a world, but it's glowing white, my ears ringing with the fierce roar of the current.
