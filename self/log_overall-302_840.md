# Recovery from Sickness
- 10 days wasted

# A summary of those chaos when doing software projects
- When encountering chaos, try to find the existing nomination for the system you're in, by getting the hang of the how the upper-level system works can you find a set of proven methodologies to sort out the chaos.
- It seems like whatever it was you were doing last month is within the realm of **Management Information System**, and you're the kind of guy who likes to figure out all of the context around whatever it is that you do and systemize it, so you can start with follows. If you still want to be in this gig, then stick to this roadmap for a while. **It would be better if you start as fast as possible, these knowledge might come into massive use in matter of weeks**
  - First
    - Reading **Management Information System**
    - Implemenation using **Java**
    - Keep polishing and consolidating your system-implementation-level front-end skills by
      - Write a component demo once a day
        - *This you need more reading on Management Information System to get yourself a more valid requirement set for practice*
        - I've always wanted to do such, but it would mean absolutely nothing if it's not connected to the Management System itself, these must come in tandem
      - Reading Vue & React source code
      - Reading high quality system implementation code
  - Second
    - Deployment using AWS
    - ...

# 对于自身一些有趣的观察
- 状态
  - 广撒网, 蜻蜓点水
	  - 在好奇心和研究欲的地狱中挣扎着维持主线剧情的推动
  - 主线剧情推动不力, 剧情发展过于缓慢
    - Although you don't need that much social economic state and your network doesn't impose too much on reputation and tight trust network, it still seems a bit too slow for your progression in IT skills
    - 目前主线剧情大致确定了，技术 - 前端，Java后端数据库，AWS三板斧 辅助-pm
        - 期待行动: 有整体闭环的文字产出（须与ground truth layer保持一致）并保持一段时间之后再找人咨询
- 原因
  - 由于系统对于每个信息都有其定位, 且都能感知到其价值链，所以任何信息都可引起兴趣
  - 然而一个人一天只有24小时, 一个月只有29~31天，你是人，所以时间有限
  - 无法倒向任何一个极端, 需要在个中求得一个较优点
- 行动
  - 定义主线剧情体验及action item
  - Maybe you can trick yourself into thinking that WHAT WILL WORK is actually not important at all, then according to your habit, you will attack it rigorously
  - 太过诱惑但确定无即用的知识，争取眼不见为净

# 对世界的一点的+1认知
- 如果学的东西对标的客户群普遍都是非常卷, 那出道的那一天免不了也是非常卷; 然而15岁之前其父母能够巧妙掌舵或者对象认知通过神秘力学掌握了该原理并自身掌舵的群体不会超过0.1%
- 在商业真空停留, 可以让人保持一种不卷+有路子的鱼和熊掌兼得的状态, 然而商业生态中的真空泡泡很少
    -  Echo from the past: Right here again. You're an empty shell, but what do you choose to fill? When？
- Ego, Man card, Recognition is the cheapest to lose compared to virtue, drive, and more
    - Hence, feigning can be used as a tool for cooling down a tough entity while actually being detached so no actual psychological damage is imposed
    - Chameleon needs more load, each refinement requires adding load until breakdown, if you have achieved too much renown, each breakdown will have exponentially worse effect, so do it when you're still young
- 对于产品的思考，一开始思考，便无法停止，by 无法停止 I mean 一生

# Classroom的上课形式, which scenario to use?
- User story
  - Prepared
  - Unprepared
    - Energy leak due to 
      - lack of weighing parameters
      - necessary pause for context refill

# About your reluctance to do intense preparation before anything
- You'd like the scenario that your ability is ten times greater than what a work item entails, in a way it's a coward's act

# A suddent new recognition of why you're no so happy
- 2022/2/15: 你不幸福的原因是, 你还没有非常成功地经历过: 筹划, 管理, 落地一件**极其极其极其复杂**的事情, 类似终极智慧挑战
  - 还有就是入局/建立一个系统能够每天批量经历商业逻辑闭环, 软件工程是个大怪兽, 所以需要有一些平行线程, 能够提前进行一些商业逻辑闭环的训练, 待至软件工程这块成熟之后再加进来
    - Holy shit, that pretty much concludes why I'm not happy
    - Horrifying, you're telling the truth, but it's doable

# About your mental pressure when something is managed
- When something is managed, you will feel the pressure and anxiousness because you can clearly see **what level of commitment you need to instill everyday** and sometimes **exactly what to do everyday so as not to fall off the wagon**. Outside this blissful ignorance, comes the dragon of chaos breathing down your neck, yet if you don't enter this realm, you don't get to grow. **The fear of failure** and **overcoming the genuine feeling of weakness in face of the challenge** is what sparks growth, **the wisdom and competency not to overdo it when nobody is pushing** is equally important, be willing to **step out of learned helplessness, tearing down all the numbness regardless of pain and be a child newborn to grow again** awaits for that moment

# 2022/2/18: 对人才模型的新型认知
- 目前的状态, 你不是*一*型人才, 也不是'I'型人才, 不是'T'型人才, 不是$\pi$型人才, 你是什么?
  - 你是散点型人才  
    - 那好, 第一, 这个命题是不是伪命题
    - 何为散点型人才?
      - 散点型人才有啥价值?
    - 你有没有对Ground-Truth level的Context进行rigorous research?
  - ACTION: 如果你TMD N年之后恰巧对于企业HR的整个运作流程有清晰的认知的话, 请把这些辣鸡加进去
  - UPDATE: 你有一, 有多个竖杠, 其中有两个竖杠有点深, 然后有很多散点, 散点比正常人要深一点, 有潜在内部逻辑

Don't worry, whatever things you give full attention to, you will not forget every last detail, you can do that after crazy more years when every last bit of sensible things are washed off and become interesting stories~ Treat everything with care, self-transformation blablabla, look for solutions, ask for help, open yourself up, since you have basic independence if things go awry even if you tried, then treat it like you don't have any choice then make it happen, during this time window this .... **thing** will become your complimentory tool whenever you need help that *this thing* can give 

NO ANYMORE OVERHEAD ALLOWED THEREAFTER unless THE_NEXT_STAGE is triggered

Very hard to open up, TOO MUCH PAIN, Too much... things, fractured bones, torn up souls, buildings blown apart, debris piling up... Like I am sleeping in the ocean so deep, yet if I want to shoot for the surface, my... ability to NOT BREATHE would be uprooted permanently, then I pre-visioned myself,  on an on, every time, the ending would picture my cold body, suffocated... So many years, he had been building this re-surface accelerator, to fight the time of death, with the restraint of not surfacing, yet he tried and failed, again, and again. But it's only a matter of time, that he, will see the lovely sky and those surfers, wow...
Before that, he just needs to build, and endure, one more day, one more year... You had suffered too many deaths already, yet you're still here, what's the damage it will make for another try that may even end up you being up the surface? Start hold it, action

Ok _COMMITMENT will be on halt even for weekend before XXXX, and awaits
