# Recovery from Sickness
- 10 days wasted

# A summary of those chaos when doing software projects
- When encountering chaos, try to find the existing nomination for the system you're in, by getting the hang of the how the upper-level system works can you find a set of proven methodologies to sort out the chaos.
- It seems like whatever it was you were doing last month is within the realm of **Management Information System**, and you're the kind of guy who likes to figure out all of the context around whatever it is that you do and systemize it, so you can start with follows. If you still want to be in this gig, then stick to this roadmap for a while. **It would be better if you start as fast as possible, these knowledge might come into massive use in matter of weeks**
  - First
    - Reading **Management Information System**
    - Implemenation using **Java**
    - Keep polishing and consolidating your system-implementation-level front-end skills by
      - Write a component demo once a day
        - *This you need more reading on Management Information System to get yourself a more valid requirement set for practice*
        - I've always wanted to do such, but it would mean absolutely nothing if it's not connected to the Management System itself, these must come in tandem
      - Reading Vue & React source code
      - Reading high quality system implementation code
  - Second
    - Deployment using AWS
    - ...

# 对于自身一些有趣的观察
- 状态
  - 广撒网, 蜻蜓点水
	  - 在好奇心和研究欲的地狱中挣扎着维持主线剧情的推动
  - 主线剧情推动不力, 剧情发展过于缓慢
    - Although you don't need that much social economic state and your network doesn't impose too much on reputation and tight trust network, it still seems a bit too slow for your progression in IT skills
    - 目前主线剧情大致确定了，技术 - 前端，Java后端数据库，AWS三板斧 辅助-pm
        - 期待行动: 有整体闭环的文字产出（须与ground truth layer保持一致）并保持一段时间之后再找人咨询
- 原因
  - 由于系统对于每个信息都有其定位, 且都能感知到其价值链，所以任何信息都可引起兴趣
  - 然而一个人一天只有24小时, 一个月只有29~31天，你是人，所以时间有限
  - 无法倒向任何一个极端, 需要在个中求得一个较优点
- 行动
  - 定义主线剧情体验及action item
  - Maybe you can trick yourself into thinking that WHAT WILL WORK is actually not important at all, then according to your habit, you will attack it rigorously
  - 太过诱惑但确定无即用的知识，争取眼不见为净

# 对世界的一点的+1认知
- 如果学的东西对标的客户群普遍都是非常卷, 那出道的那一天免不了也是非常卷; 然而15岁之前其父母能够巧妙掌舵或者对象认知通过神秘力学掌握了该原理并自身掌舵的群体不会超过0.1%
- 在商业真空停留, 可以让人保持一种不卷+有路子的鱼和熊掌兼得的状态, 然而商业生态中的真空泡泡很少
    -  Echo from the past: Right here again. You're an empty shell, but what do you choose to fill? When？
- Ego, Man card, Recognition is the cheapest to lose compared to virtue, drive, and more
    - Hence, feigning can be used as a tool for cooling down a tough entity while actually being detached so no actual psychological damage is imposed
    - Chameleon needs more load, each refinement requires adding load until breakdown, if you have achieved too much renown, each breakdown will have exponentially worse effect, so do it when you're still young
- 对于产品的思考，一开始思考，便无法停止，by 无法停止 I mean 一生

- 旅行共享衣物套装
    - 在人类旅行的关键地点：机场，旅馆，居民区等地区布设共享衣物机，内设一整套换洗衣物
        - 那这些衣物的物流如何实现？
            - 基本用户闭环分析：旅行计划-->整理行装（你的想法的目标价值应该是把这个步骤完全清除，任意时长，复杂度的旅行带的物品不超过3个，或者一个小包over行李）--> LOOP 旅途 --> 旅途住所/旅途里程碑 EOLP --> 家/旅途终点
            - 闭环plug：一次性衣服: 低成本，可丢弃，可回收，可“体面”地在公共场合穿着
                - 为何低成本？材料？可降解衣物材料？
                - 可丢弃？丢哪里？
                    - 我们为什么能大规模丢弃餐巾纸？如果餐巾纸的某些性质有何改变，餐巾纸丢弃的“沉重感”会增加？
