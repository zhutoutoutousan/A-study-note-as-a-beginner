# A summary of those chaos when doing software projects
- When encountering chaos, try to find the existing nomination for the system you're in, by getting the hang of the how the upper-level system works can you find a set of proven methodologies to sort out the chaos.
- It seems like whatever it was you were doing last month is within the realm of **Management Information System**, and you're the kind of guy who likes to figure out all of the context around whatever it is that you do and systemize it, so you can start with follows. If you still want to be in this gig, then stick to this roadmap for a while. **It would be better if you start as fast as possible, these knowledge might come into massive use in matter of weeks**
  - First
    - Reading **Management Information System**
    - Implemenation using **Java**
    - Keep polishing and consolidating your system-implementation-level front-end skills by
      - Write a component demo once a day
        - *This you need more reading on Management Information System to get yourself a more valid requirement set for practice*
        - I've always wanted to do such, but it would mean absolutely nothing if it's not connected to the Management System itself, these must come in tandem
      - Reading Vue & React source code
      - Reading high quality system implementation code

# 对于自身一些有趣的观察
- 状态
  - 广撒网, 蜻蜓点水
  - 主线剧情推动不力, 剧情发展过于缓慢

  - 然而一个人一天只有24小时, 一个月只有29~31天
  - 无法倒向任何一个极端, 需要在个中求得一个较优点
- 行动
  - 定义主线剧情体验及action item

# 对世界残酷的一点的+1认知
- 从小到大, 如果你学的东西对标的客户群普遍都是非常卷, 那出道的那一天免不了也是非常卷; 然而15岁之前父母能够巧妙掌舵或者对象认知通过量子力学掌握了该原理之后的群体挺少的
  - You're adventageous, if you settle on something firm, then you will seek for something that would tip you right off the edge, but not to the level of *typical domestic hungry downtrodden seeking social economic status for social-dominance-orientation-satisfaction-oriented-programming*, something would cause you to suffer from mental breakdown, but now, everything will be recorded, archived so the future self can see EXACTLY what was going on and improve upon it
- 在商业真空停留, 可以让人保持一种不卷+有路子的鱼和熊掌兼得的状态, 然而商业生态中的真空泡泡很少
