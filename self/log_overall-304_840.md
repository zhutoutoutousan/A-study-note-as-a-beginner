- Before starting deep work, start your meditation and meanwhile put the work item & context into your mind

# Words of advice from others
- You have nullified sense towards others' boundries
  - Discussion
    - Yep, I'd like to creep on others for fun, maybe it's the ESTP/INTP trait
    - Tangible actions will ensue if both feasibility and self-assumed win-win scenario is present
    - Gradual encroachment is normal among animals, without attempts of encroachment, there would be no clear sense of boundry, which is not very good for future cooperation contrary to normal human beings' believes.
  - VERDICT One has to take a leap of faith, RISKING LOSING one or more nodes of NETWORK RESOURCE, encroach and then take a step back if boundry is met, to avoid the same. BUT, here is a BIG BUT, you need to keep track of others' boundries, especially business partners, spouse, descendents etc. for evolutive relationship management. For network nodes with malicious intent, the nature of management strategy will be drastically different
  - You need to work well with ENFJ, ESFP, ESFJ, you need them to grow your business

- HR市场的简历机制本身就是打教育系统的脸, 未来的企业招聘机制应该是直接通过提炼学生从小到大教育经历所积累的大量数据学习, 给予推荐的报告及参考数据集, 这样就可以更好的提升企业的招聘效率和招聘, 同时也可以更好的提升学生的求职能力。 所以未来教育系统改革的关键在于更细致地收集学生数据和报表生成, 在不同阶段的教育系统进行无缝对接
