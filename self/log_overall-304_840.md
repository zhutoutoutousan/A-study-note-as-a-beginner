# __STATE__
## MEDITATED
- Without meditation, your hyper-active brain will sabotage your efficiency by dragging you around millions of shallow stuffs, tons of startup ideas, shallow digging and research. Were they not shallow, you should've started a company already
- Before starting deep work, start your meditation and meanwhile put the work item & context into your mind

  - Material Track
    - TOPIC SHIFT: Since you have ditched the idea of joining the army to cultivate innate sense of discipline for sub-optimal ROI and enough alternatives, you have to compensate it with knowledge and proficiency for the future business war, add in ACCA to replace touchy-feelies, French section is about `politics`, `war`, `justice`, `law` and anything related

# Words of advice from others
- You have nullified sense towards others' boundries
  - Discussion
    - Yep, I'd like to creep on others for fun, maybe it's the ESTP/INTP trait
    - Tangible actions will ensue if both feasibility and self-assumed win-win scenario is present
    - Gradual encroachment is normal among animals, without attempts of encroachment, there would be no clear sense of boundry, which is not very good for future cooperation contrary to normal human beings' believes.
  - VERDICT One has to take a leap of faith, RISKING LOSING one or more nodes of NETWORK RESOURCE, encroach and then take a step back if boundry is met, to avoid the same. BUT, here is a BIG BUT, you need to keep track of others' boundries, especially business partners, spouse, descendents etc. for evolutive relationship management. For network nodes with malicious intent, the nature of management strategy will be drastically different
  - You need to work well with ENFJ, ESFP, ESFJ, you need them to grow your business

- HR市场的简历机制本身就是打教育系统的脸, 未来的企业招聘机制应该是直接通过提炼学生从小到大教育经历所积累的大量数据学习, 给予推荐的报告及参考数据集, 这样就可以更好的提升企业的招聘效率和招聘, 同时也可以更好的提升学生的求职能力。 所以未来教育系统改革的关键在于更细致地收集学生数据和报表生成, 在不同阶段的教育系统进行无缝对接

- 最近通过你自己做事的方法我可以总结出你的某些行事风格 --> `business_teamplay`
  - 通过与国际MVP团队的沟通过程中, 我发现了你某些行事上的问题
    - Case 1
    - 可是和UI/UX, SME沟通过程有木有现成框架可以用呀?
      - Google
      - 问人
      - 在这个所谓self-coaching笔记里找
  - NEW HABIT: teamplay case study
- ENTJ | Manager-like personality
  - 珍惜能在企业内部创业的机会
  - 如果在MVP情况下, 不要想着我可以不可以把这个role做到80%或者70%, 如果大家都是接口型, 对你的realm不熟悉, 处于layman level, 或者处于silo型沟通, 或者没有足够时间,或者给予足够信任状态下, 那必须得调动资源把认知范围之内的role做到120%, 处于100%以下是一定会出问题的, 要不是fail to follow-up just in time
    - 不要希望于自我欺骗: 
      1. 别人会把沟通搞定 
      2. 别人就算把沟通搞定了, 事情也会落实 
        - 有毛病不?
        - 怎么做?
      3. `学习`很重要, 但不要寄希望于自己可以通过`学习`来搞定
        - Reasoning
          1. 管理本身就是一个逐层抽象, 风险信托的过程, 而在执行层中`学习`的对象是一个具象的流程, 学习的结果是流程产出的`效率`和`质量`的提升, 具有高度的执行者可替代性, 那作为执行层的role, 1. 通过沟通协调调动合适的资源, 2. 独立学习, 哪个更有价值? 哪个更能够规避风险? 明显是第一个
      4. Mental Dump 
         1. *我不需要去跟进, 跟进了说明自己不牛逼* 
           - 有毛病不?
           - 怎么做?
         2. *跟进了, 别人会认为自己不牛逼, 太辣鸡*
           - 有毛病不?
         - `( •̀ ω •́ )y`
