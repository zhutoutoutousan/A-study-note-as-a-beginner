        - *You should have a mental Gantt Chart/Network nodes with additional information of all possible projects both occupational and individual in mind, that's the minimum intellectual capability requirement, if not, I sincerely demand that you have before the age of 30s*
        - *SWBOK, PMBOK, TOGAF, SOP, _law, _money in tandem with projects are musts in your path, don't you shy away from it, get with the system*

        - *You can't be irresponsible for every one of your actions, think about the value chain, think about the atmosphere, there's gonna be some motto to live up to*
        - *Don't you abuse someone else's trust, try everything to achieve it or you should be ashamed by your incompetence or misconduct*
        - *Build up Trust *
