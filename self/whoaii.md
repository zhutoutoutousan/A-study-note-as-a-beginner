- SELF-TRANSFORMATION: FIVE GUYS - WORK AS A TEAM
  - Internal struggle
    - 职业经理人/策划统筹者 -->  M
      - 2022/3
        - *NESTED ALTERNATIVE PLAN TREE should have at least depth of 3 and at least 3 paths with less than 20% of PERCEIVED OVERALL EFFORT and 2 folds of NEST OVERALL BENEFIT WITH INTRINSIC COSTS should be available to ensure ECOSYSTEM-INVARIANT INDEPENDENCE both individual and project-based*
        - *Ensure efficient self-data collection for callibration*
        - *Everything should be well-documented for effective communication, since you type fast enough as compensation*
        - *Every process should be automated or at least expedited*
        - *Don't get hasty, one step at a time, be a realist when it comes to design and implementation*
        - *You should have a mental Gantt Chart/Network nodes with additional information of all possible projects both occupational and individual in mind, that's the minimum intellectual capability requirement, if not, I sincerely demand that you have before the age of 30s*
        - *SWBOK, PMBOK, TOGAF, SOP, _law, _money in tandem with projects are musts in your path, don't you shy away from it, get with the system*
        - *Get with the local ecosystem a.k.a politique against all humiliations and occupational deaths, you can't achieve much being a lone wolf, nor can you achieve anything being a helpless child*
        - *You can't be irresponsible for every one of your actions, think about the value chain, think about the atmosphere, there's gonna be some motto to live up to*
        - *Don't you abuse someone else's trust, try everything to achieve it or you should be ashamed by your incompetence or misconduct*
        - *Build up Trust*

      - 2022/3/16
        - Once you convinced yourself of your idea, you will ditch every last bit of introvert trait
        - *I'm not afraid of death, actually I love dying for multiple times on a minute basis, and I strive to die at a higher rate then gather every last bit of data possible*
        - *I'm not afraid of hostilities, actually, it gives me the adrenaline boost, it prompts me to focus on what really matters, sometimes I even actively, subconsiously provoke a hostile environment for self adrenaline boost*
        - *Strike out regardless if you are ready since you're young*
        - *Patience, hold your horses until you've thought them through*
        - *Life is too short for long-term grudges*
        - *During rigorous competitions, one should not be constrained by rigid, ecosystem dependent, era & zeitgeitst-variant moral stipulations unless it affects playing field status or tendencies by public opinion system, actually, the methods should be everything but, being a good hacker is a must to get an edge in the game*
        - *I HATE repetitive work*
        - *Zurich Axiom: In the long run, we'd all be dead*
        - *Design, cultivate a product that would change the world*
        - *My perceived level of being insufficient has reached yet another level, it's time to ask for help*
    - 译员/协调者 --> T

      - *I enjoy helping people from drastically different background understand one another*

      - 2022/3
        - *Patience, think out of the box*
        - *Always try the new things*
        - *Engineering practices and appetites are to be enforced to oneself, but un-opinionated towards others...unless they are stupid and beyond the pale...myself included*
        - *What if I piece these things together? What's its business model?*
    - 学术人/科学家 --> S
      - 2022/3
        - *The world is but a giant experimenting field*
        - *Leave the generation with test data for more insight towards the working principle of this world*

- What I've seen over the last few months
  - Due to the five concurrent running people, you can't perform each one to the maximum capacity.
  - I'm pretty surprised the likes of you can endure a labor contract for more than 6 months
  - You just don't know to look over your shoulder, you're constantly *在死亡线上试探*
