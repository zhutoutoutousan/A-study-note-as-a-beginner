# Read through documentations faster
- Maybe you can do documentation speed reading from time to time for a particular genre for a general grasp
  - A workout style or warm up would be good
  - Maybe you can list a workout list
    - Backend framework 
    - Front-end framework 
  - Keep a certain amount of speed and momentum, only slow down when you really think it's gonna be beneficial for the coding task ahead
  - Don't limit yourself to the API
  - Don't get too slow, as a warm up, you should finish in no more than 6 minutes per stack
  - Habit
    - Maybe everyday before you start coding in some framework, take a quick glance, workout style
