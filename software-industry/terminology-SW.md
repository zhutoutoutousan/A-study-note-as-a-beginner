### Class
- (ES6)
- (java)A java class is a group of data items with associated functions that can perform operations on that data. The data items in a calss are called *variables*, or sometimes *fields*; in Java, functions are called *methods*.
  - As in other object-oriented languages, classes are application components that hold executable code and data. Compiled Java classes are distributed in a universal binary format that contains Java bytecode and other class information.
  - Java class can be maintained discretly and stored in files or archives locally or on a network server.
  - Java classes are located and loaded dynamically at runtime as they are needed by an application.

### Execusion context 执行上下文
- (ECMAScript)**Execution context** is a concept in the language spec that---in Layman's terms---roughly equates to the 'environment' a function executes in, i.e., variable scope(and the *scope chain*, variables)
  - [What is the 'Execution Context' in JavaScript exactly?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9384758/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript-exactly#:~:text=Execution%20context%20is%20a%20concept,value%20of%20the%20this%20object.)
  - [ECMA-262-3 in detail. Chapter 1. Execution Contexts.](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-1-execution-contexts/)
- An execution context forms upon a function invocation. This context places itself on an execution stack, an order of operations. The item that is always first in this stack is the global execution context. Next up are any function created contexts.

## J
### Java
- Java is both a compiled and an interpreted language. Java source code is turned into simple binary instructions, much like ordinary microprocessor machine code.
  - See virtual machine
- The fundamental unit of Java code is the *class*

### Java build tools
- Examples
  - Maven
### Java Bytecode
- (java)Compiled Java *bytecode* is executed by a Java runtime interpreter.
### Java data type
- In Java, every class defines a new *data type* 

### Java inheritance
### Java interperter
### Java method
- See ```java``` section
### Java native methods
- In addition to the platform-specific runtime system, Java has a number of fundamental classes that contain architecture-depenedent methods. These *native methods* serve as the gateway between the Java virtual machine and the real world. They are implemented in a natively compiled language on the host platform and provide low-level access to resources such as the network, the windowing system, and the host filesystem.
### Java object reference
- A *reference* is a pointer to or a handle for an object.
- If you declare a class-type variable without assigning it an object, it doens't point to anything. It's assigned the default value of ```null```, meaning 'no value'. If you try to use a variable with a null value as if it were poingting to a real object, a runtime error, ```NullPointerException```, occurs.
### Java runtime
### Java virtual machine
- (java)Whereas ```C``` or ```C++``` source is reduced to native instructions for a particular model of processor, Java source is compiled into a universal format---instructions for a *virtual machine*

### JDK
- JDK: Java Developement Kit
### JIT
- JIT: just-in-time or dynamic compilation
  - Java has been carefully designed so that software implementations of the runtime system can further optimize their performance by compiling bytecode to native machine code on the fly.
### JFC
### JRE
- JRE: Java Runtime Environment
- Examples
  - Execution environment
    - JavaSE
  - Project specific JRE
## L
### Locale
- In computing, a **locale** is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, region and any speical variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface.
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software))
### Lookahead/lookbehind
- (regex)

### LXC
- LXC: Linux Containers
  - **LXC** is an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems(containers) on a control host using a single Linux kernel.
- Plz work on your OS working principle to know more

### LXD
## M
### ```main size```
- (front-end)     主轴空间
### Methods
- (Vue.js) Methods in Vue.js are bound to the Vue instance, they are incredibly useful for  functions you would like to access in directives
- You can use arrow functions within the method, but the method cannot be an arrow function

### Mocha
- Mocha is a featuer-rich JavaScript test framework running on ```Node.js``` and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.
- Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

### Mutable
### MVC
- **Model-view-controller** is a *software design pattern* commonly used for developing *user interfaces* that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
- [Model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
  - Check the anatomy graph
- Definitions:
  - **Model**: The central components of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **View**: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table.
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **Controller**: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **Service**: Between the controller and the model sometimes goes a layer which is called a service. It fetches data from the model and lets the controller use the fetched data.

### Object-oriented inheritance model
### Object-oriented language
- ?
  - The primary benefits of an object-oriented language are this association between data and functionality in class units and also the ability of classes to *encapsulate* or hide details, freeing the developer from worrying about low-level details.
### Object-oriented programming
## P
### PaaS
- PaaS: Platform as a service
- **Platform as a service(PaaS)** or **application platform as a service(aPaaS)** or platform-based service is a category of *cloud computing services* that provides a *platform* allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

- Examples
  - Heroku
### Packet switch
### Pascal case
- pascal-case
### ```PATH```
### Performance metric
### Pipe
- (programming symbol)  ```|```
### Promise
- (Web API)A **promise** is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a *promise* to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A **promise** is in one of these states:
  - *pending*: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - *fulfilled*: meaning that the operation completed

### PoC
- PoC: proof of concept
- A proof of concept(PoC) exploit is a non-harmful attack against a computer or network.

### SVG
- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics
- SVG is an XML language, similar to XHTML, which can be used to draw vector graphics. It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely.
  - Features
    - Support gradients, rotations, filter effects, animations, interactivity with JavaScript etc..
    - [What is the difference between SVG and HTML5 Canvas?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-the-difference-between-SVG-and-HTML5-Canvas#:~:text=SVG%20gives%20better%20performance%20with,or%20larger%20number%20of%20objects.&text=SVG%20is%20vector%20based%20and,based%20and%20composed%20of%20pixel.)
  - Downside
    - Loading SVG can be slow.
  - Benefits
    - There is a DOM interface available for it.(Web API)
    - Doesn't require third-party extensions.

### Vue templates
- Vue.js uses HTML-based template syntax to bind the Vue instance to the DOM, very useful for components
### Vue watcher
- (Vue.js)?
  - Watch updates the DOM only if it's required-performing calcualtions in JS is really performant but accessing the DOM is not. So we have a Virtual DOM which is like a copy, but parsed in JavaScript
  - Good for asynchronous updates, and updates/transitions with data changes
