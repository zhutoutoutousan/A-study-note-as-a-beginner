      - #testtaking
        - For exams from the nebenselementen of which you can extract previous experience, you can simply apply test-driven first
        - For exams that doens't meet this criteria, rigorously input-output resource gathering should be run instead
    - CCS: 100%
      - **WARNING: Concurrent running of German, English, AWS SysOps context with 2x speed for 1.5 hr daily is exceeding your innate brain processing power, microscopic raw intelligence increment detected, increment pattern & logic encapsulated, future gamification and product design rigged and archived, constant internal system radical re-structuring opportunity trigger point hit, learning effectiveness of AWS SysOps jeopardized, time overrun mitigated but still outstanding**
