## 2021/9/27-2021/10/17 AWS Developer Associate Attestation
#attestationcontrol
### Paradigm 1: 2021/9/27-2021/10/7
#### Kickstart
- The power has been decided that you shall take your attestation on 2021/10/17
- Know what you're facing
  - 22% Deployment 14.3Q
  - 26% Security 17Q
  - 30% Development with AWS Services 19.5Q
  - 10% Refactoring 6.5Q
  - 12% Monitoring and Troubleshooting 7.8Q
#### Mindset adjustment
#distributedmindsetmanagement
- Texas Poker: Commit yourself åæ­åè·¯å¨èº«æå¥
  - Enough composure
  - Enough alignment with self and pre-vision of growth path
  - If you can't even adopt and internalize the ability to use this mindset to empower yourself and clear out a path, then you really have no business working as a consultant
  - 2021/10/9: Create a second-line sophistication to this mind-set to prevent core damage and encapsulate this neural change
- Up-tight risk control
  - Manage all parts of your time to ensure a full commitment with minimum risk
#### Resources
- OneNote --> Please migrate to this temp space as resource pool for reference

#### Current risk
- INTJ
  - HIGH RISK: *Good job! All the effort for nothing*: OMG!!! I overslept!!!
    - Solved by creating this whateveritis
    - Triggered: 2021/10/9
      - Second-line sophistication triggered
        - Callousness applied
        - Stoicism applied
  - MEDIUM RISK: *Why should I need help from others?*
  - LOW RISK: *What date should I take the test again?*
- Schedule clashing
  - May clash with projects
  - No clash with TestDaf 11/9
  - No clash with CATTI 11/9
  - Pending project schedule
- Mindset
  - LOW RISK: Legacy personal idiosyncracy as blockages
    - *Scholar's Arrogance*: *èå¤«ä»¥ä¿®èº«ä¸ºå·±ä»», å®å¾ä»¥è¯ä¹¦ä¸ºéç©ä¹?*
      - Solved by creating migratable knowledge store to shun this quirk
      - Through years' working experience, the mindset is deprecated, but some behavioural patterns might stick around
  - LOW RISK: *Numb*: *I always eat deadlines for breakfast, before it arrives*
- Exam readiness: *Mexico is way up there, and you're down here*
  - HIGH RISK: Shock therapy test reveals estimated failure if no effort is exerted
  - Requires efforts that you might need to clear up more time for the exam
#### Planning phase 
- Shock therapy: Take the test first: 2021/9/28
  - Platform
    - Knowledgehut
  - Results
    - Scored 4/60
    - Estimated failure if you don't do anything
  - Action
    - Enrichment of knowledge structure for `toddler` section
      - Partial review
      - Partial memory by force
      - Partial internalization

    - More effort allocated to flashcards to solidify the notion
      - Desired state
        - 100% Mastery level of flashcards
          - 6% per day --> Possible heavy workload
            - **2021/10/7**: ENTJ/INTJ - Dude, your current mastery level is 12.7%, which is subpar, do it better to catch up with the number or GET DEMOLISHED
            - **2021/10/11**: Dude, your current mastery level is 38.7%, which is subpar, do it better to catch up with the number or GET DEMOLISHED
              - Shun ENTJ part for mental contingency maneuver
              - Contingency plan imminent
              - Mock test imminent
              - Underlying manifestation of current illness imminent
              - Evidence shows that you can complete 30% a day with insane schedule and more coffee applied

        - Video knowledge enrichment w1=0.3 , knowledge structure internalization w2=0.4, exam state internalization w3=0.3
    - Starting to take down those questions you've got wrong 
      - Intuition: This may not be a good idea
  - Trend
    - Linearly speaking: With 4 days you scored 16 more, it is estimated that you will pass the test with current effort level, but more data needs to be collected
- Next Test: 2021/10/12 Mastery Level: 60%
  - Studying over normal schedule imminent
- **Gradually-shorter INTERVAL MOCK TESTS**: As mastery level and fill-the-gaps video learning goes, the interval between two mock test will become shorter and shorter until the efficiency of the feedback loop reaches the singularity as the internalization level peaks, then try to calculate the maintenance interval 
- **Failsafe mechanism**: If you fail, you will get the valuable data gained for future adjustments
