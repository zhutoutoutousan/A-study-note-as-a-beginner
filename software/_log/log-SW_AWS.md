## 2021/9/27-2021/10/17 AWS Developer Associate Attestation
#awsattestation
### Paradigm 1: 2021/9/27-2021/10/7
#### Kickstart
- The power has been decided that you shall take your attestation on 2021/10/17

#### Mindset adjustment
#distributedmindsetmanagement
- Texas Poker: Commit yourself 切断后路全身投入
  - Enough composure
  - Enough alignment with self and pre-vision of growth path
  - If you can't even adopt and internalize the ability to use this mindset to empower yourself and clear out a path, then you really have no business working as a consultant
- Up-tight risk control
  - Manage all parts of your time to ensure a full commitment with minimum risk
#### Resources
- OneNote --> Please migrate to this temp space as resource pool for reference

#### Current risk
- Schedule clashing
  - May clash with projects
  - No clash with TestDaf 11/9
