# marzipano Circle CI setup error
## 2021/3/21

It seems like two sequences of errors, first error is this: 

```

> marzipano@0.10.2 test D:\GitHub\marzipano
> testem ci

not ok 1 testem - [undefined ms] - testem
    ---
        message: >
            Error: spawn browserify ENOENT
    ...
Unhandled rejection Error: spawn rm ENOENT
    at notFoundError (D:\GitHub\marzipano\node_modules\cross-spawn\lib\enoent.js:6:26)
    at verifyENOENT (D:\GitHub\marzipano\node_modules\cross-spawn\lib\enoent.js:40:16)

    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:275:12)

```

And then if I try to do it again, it would report `Error: listen EADDRINUSE`

News: 2021/3/23: 
I discovered that the directory `/scripts/*`, all the files in there were **linux code**, so it might not support windows development environment

I tried `kali linux` in WSL after failing in `w10` in the same environment, it reports the same `EADDRINUSE` error    


If I visit localhost:7357, it says `testem` uses this port to run tests

# I am lazy, so I want to connect to my laptop using ssh :) It's sort of cool anyway~ÔºÅ

1. Connection refused...
   - Pinging the local address shows `timeout  `
   - I did some browsing, it seems like my goal is to connect my PC to a wirelessly-connected laptop under the same router
   - Maybe it is due to the router wireless isolation, so it should be...
   - Yep, easy-peasy, the password didn't even change for SDN
   - Got a lot to see there
     - What is `LOID`?
       - [damn RED](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/el61wq/what_is_loid_configuration_in_routers/)
     - What is `PON`?
       - [Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network)
   - Those SDN interface currently couldn't tell me shit about unlocking the wireless isolation...Umm, maybe try doing some research about its manufacturer `fiberhome`? Get to know a bit more about how router works? Or it is not even the problem with the isolation, just my another instance of ignorance?
   - Here's some information I dug up
