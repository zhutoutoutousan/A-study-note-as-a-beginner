## Checking out `chromium`
Just today, not that I couldn't be less productive, I wanna check out on `chromium` source code just for the hell of it~ Starting from [here](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md)

System requirements.. check... damn, at least `100GB of free disk space...` namm, maybe next time xD

Screw it, just read it online... Even if it may be even less productive

Now, here's the workbench with a few resources in the pool:

- [Getting Around the Chromium Source Code Directory Structure](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/getting-around-the-chrome-source-code)
- [source](https://www.chromium.org/developers)

It's a bit confusing...Maybe I would just dilly-dally around for a while.. For *a while* I mean several years :)))
