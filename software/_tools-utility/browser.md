# Chrome
## Navigation
- I want to quickly access the tab I opened in a bunch of Chrome tabs with just a few keyword inputs
  - Just mash `O` and search
## Useful plug-ins
- I want to only use keystrokes to navigate through all those pages: Vimium

## Keyboard shortcuts
### Visual navigation
- Scroll to top/bottom:    
  - Windows: Home/End
### History navigation
- Reopen recently closed tab: Ctrl + Shift + T
- Return to the previously opened tab
  - Install the [Google extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/previous-tab/bjaniflnlhhofabpoamhnobeonjcjjpl?hl=en#:~:text=Switch%20back%20to%20the%20previously,Ctrl%2B%60%20as%20keyboard%20shortcuts.)
