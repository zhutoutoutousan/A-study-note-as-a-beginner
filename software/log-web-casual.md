## I am lazy, so I want to connect to my laptop using ssh :) It's sort of cool anyway~ÔºÅ

1. Connection refused...
   - Pinging the local address shows `timeout  `
   - I did some browsing, it seems like my goal is to connect my PC to a wirelessly-connected laptop under the same router
   - Maybe it is due to the router wireless isolation, so it should be...
   - Yep, easy-peasy, the password didn't even change for SDN
   - Got a lot to see there
     - What is `LOID`?
       - [damn RED](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/el61wq/what_is_loid_configuration_in_routers/)
     - What is `PON`?
       - [Manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network)
   - Those SDN interface currently couldn't tell me shit about unlocking the wireless isolation...Umm, maybe try doing some research about its manufacturer `fiberhome`? Get to know a bit more about how router works? Or it is not even the problem with the isolation, just my another instance of ignorance?
   - Here's some information I dug up
