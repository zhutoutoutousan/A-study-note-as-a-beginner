# Study style(Academic)
## The science behind learning
### Basic rules
- Like weightlifting and bodybuilding, learning something difficult takes time
  - But how to get an accurate measure towards certain contents?
- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
- The more abstract the idea is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you
- Cramming does not only hurt the integrity of your knowledge structure, but also brings negative emotions towards the target subject if done wrong. However, in some extreme scenarios it serves as the only option. Only use this technique when you have a very good reason.
- For EE, it would be a good practice to learn by starting a project.
### Focused modes
- Used when dealing with old patterns
### Diffuse modes
- Used when creating new patterns or neural pathways(to understand something new)
- The diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area. In spite of its abstract nature, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete
### Memory
#### Long term memory
- It takes some time and repetitions to extract the information or thought patterns from the immense ocean of long term memory.
##### Spaced repetition
##### Forgetting curve
Four key time stamps to review what I've learned:
- 10 min
- 24 hrs
- 1 week
- 1 month
#### Working memory
- The working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex
- The working memory can store only about four chunks of information
- The short-term memory can be taken as an inefficient mental blackboard that is constantly fading away. Repetitions required for information to stay.
### Procrastination
- It seems that the procrastination between each training/study session(less than 15 minutes) can serve as a temporary relax. Just to ease the psychological and physical obstacles for starting from where I left off.
#### Pomodoro
- Maybe for studying some very difficult content, this might work, and the parameter shifts to 'more rest, less study' side as the difficulty rises.
- When you are sick, don't use Pomodoro too strictly. Check [HEALTH](./health-and-fitness.md)
- When you are doing coding, especially those front-end code, the best practice that works for this entity would be: working long hours, taking long breaks - until enlightened otherwise
- Pomodoro methods may be suitable for intense study(The average intensity of the study process induced by the very study methods and paces surpasses the minimum threshold the actual extent of which is yet to be measured)

## Subject-oriented implementation: Time to put the theory to test
### Engineering
#### The importance of the conceptual structure and terminologies
- Learning the conceptual structure and terminology of the different areas of engineering mathematics is very important for three reasons:
  - It may allow you to *identify a new problem and put it into the right group of problems*. The area of engineering mathematics are growing but most often retain their conceptual structure.
  - You may *absorb new information more rapidly* by being able to fit it into the conceptual structure.
  - Knowledge of the conceptual structure and terminology is also important when *using the Internet to search for mathematical information*. Since the search proceeds by putting in key words(i.e., terms) into the search engine, you have to remember the important concepts(or be able to look them up in the book) that identify the application and area of engineering mathematics or else.

### Software engineering
#### The implementation of the forgetting curve to the knowledge structure categorization
- Check ```leetcode``` section and you'll know


### Psychology
- First question is, how do you build an efficient strategy of reading, study and observation given a certain goal.


## Quotes
- Impeccable definitions have little value at the beginning of the study of a subject. The best way to find out what *xxx* is about is to start doing it. Proceeding through even with the qualms about the meaning and purpose of the subject can be considered.

# Standardized Tests
## Language
### IELTS
- Steve Kaumann: Training for the test brings few merit when it comes to acquiring a language.
### TOEFL
- Steve Kaumann: Training for the test brings few merit when it comes to acquiring a language.

- Italian
- English
## Academic
### GRE
### GMAT

# Optional tests

# Skillsets
## Academic information searching
### Automation tools
- :d
## Academic reading
### Original research reports
- **Anatomy**: Each of the original research reports contains four principle sections:
  1. First there is an *introduction*, in which the author states the idea, where it came from, and why it's important, and distills the idea down to a hypothesis or series of hypotheses.
  2. This is followed by a *procedure* section, in which the author tests the hypothesis by translating the idea into a concrete set of operations. The procedure section of a good piece of research is often the most interesting part because it requires a great deal of ingenuity for the investigator to achieve precision without sacrificing realism or impact.
  3. In the *results* section the investigator states as clearly and succinctly as possible what the findings were. The investigator uses various statistical procedures to ascertain the extent to which the data are reliable.
  4. The *discussion* section, in which the researcher evaluates and interprets the data presented in the preceding section and tries to make sense of them in the context of previous research. The creative researcher can also use this section to speculate about hte implications of the data and to point the way toward future research.
- Reading strategy
## Academic writing
### Conlude
### Analogize
- It seems that scientific readings are full with analogies, so obtaining a high level of oral and written dexterities of communication using analogy is important

# Tools
## TiddyWiki
- This stuff seems much more disorganized than this one first thought xD Once disorganized, be disorganized forever kind of stuff. Maybe the difficiency of the tool is overpowered by the overrated grandiose image of the user. BUT great for people high in traits of narscissism to bluff by looking mysterious. And very good to stand out among all the social media actors. AS LONG AS you sell other stuff that the crowd considers useful/applicable --> Book Entry: *The social animal* [dog face]
- [An example of a heavy user](https://onetwo.ren/)
  - P.S: The popular/infamous **Meme** created by Richard Dawkins is considered too shallow compared to Jung psychology and archetypes by Jordan B. Peterson, maybe it is interesting to look into.
