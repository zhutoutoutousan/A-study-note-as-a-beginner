# Study style(Academic)
## The science behind learning
### Basic rules
- Like weightlifting and bodybuilding, learning something difficult takes time
  - But how to get an accurate measure towards certain contents?
- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
- The more abstract the idea is, the more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for you
- Cramming does not only hurt the integrity of your knowledge structure, but also brings negative emotions towards the target subject if done wrong. However, in some extreme scenarios it serves as the only option. Only use this technique when you have a very good reason.
- For EE, it would be a good practice to learn by starting a project.
### Focused modes
- Used when dealing with old patterns
### Diffuse modes
- Used when creating new patterns or neural pathways(to understand something new)
- The diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area. In spite of its abstract nature, the neural thought patterns you are creating are real and concrete
### Memory
#### Long term memory
- It takes some time and repetitions to extract the information or thought patterns from the immense ocean of long term memory.
##### Spaced repetition
##### Forgetting curve
Four key time stamps to review what I've learned:
- 10 min
- 24 hrs
- 1 week
- 1 month
#### Working memory
- The working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex
- The working memory can store only about four chunks of information
- The short-term memory can be taken as an inefficient mental blackboard that is constantly fading away. Repetitions required for information to stay.
### Procrastination
#### Pomodoro
- Maybe for studying some very difficult content, this might work, and the parameter shifts to 'more rest, less study' side as the difficulty rises.
- When you are sick, don't use Pomodoro too strictly. Check [HEALTH](./health-and-fitness.md)
- When you are doing coding, especially those front-end code, the best practice that works for this entity would be: working long hours, taking long breaks - until enlightened otherwise

### P.O.I

- Terrence Sejnowski
  - Neuroscience and study techniques

## Subject-oriented implementation: Time to put the theory to test
### Engineering
#### The importance of the conceptual structure and terminologies
- Learning the conceptual structure and terminology of the different areas of engineering mathematics is very important for three reasons:
  - It may allow you to *identify a new problem and put it into the right group of problems*. The area of engineering mathematics are growing but most often retain their conceptual structure.
  - You may *absorb new information more rapidly* by being able to fit it into the conceptual structure.
  - Knowledge of the conceptual structure and terminology is also important when *using the Internet to search for mathematical information*. Since the search proceeds by putting in key words(i.e., terms) into the search engine, you have to remember the important concepts(or be able to look them up in the book) that identify the application and area of engineering mathematics.

## Quotes
- Impeccable definitions have little value at the beginning of the study of a subject. The best way to find out what *xxx* is about is to start doing it. Proceeding through even with the qualms about the meaning and purpose of the subject can be considered.
