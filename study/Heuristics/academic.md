  - Progress: 2vs/10.5hrs
# Study style(Academic)
## The science behind learning
### Basic rules
- Like weightlifting and bodybuilding, learning something difficult takes time
  - But how to get an accurate measure towards certain contents?
- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning
### Focused modes
- Used when dealing with old patterns
### Diffuse modes
- Used when creating new patterns or neural pathways(to understand something new)
- The diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area.
### Forgetting curve
Four key time stamps to review what I've learned:
- 10 min
- 24 hrs
- 1 week
- 1 month
### Resource
- [The Forgetting Curve](https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/Writing%20Program/forgetting_curve.pdf)
- [BrainFacts.org](https://www.brainfacts.org/)
### P.O.I
- Salvador Dali
- Thomas Edison
## Quotes
- Impeccable definitions have little value at the beginning of the study of a subject. The best way to find out what *xxx* is about is to start doing it. Proceeding through even with the qualms about the meaning and purpose of the subject can be considered.
