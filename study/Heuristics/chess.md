# Model
A model can be considered as a simplified analogy of life:
- In the beginning, everyone start with drastically different opening pieces, some starts with 999,999 queens and numerous number of bishops, rooks, pawns and knights, some starts with only one pawn or even none.
- Everyone starts with their level of chess play with the same ratings, but according to their original social economic level and education, their rating develops with the utmost inequality, some reaches ELO 2500 at the age of 10, while some dwells around ELO 800 at their age of 30s.
- The aspect that enables the most freedom is the choice to pick the opponent. If the opponent is too strong, mostly one has the choice to change it to a weaker one.
