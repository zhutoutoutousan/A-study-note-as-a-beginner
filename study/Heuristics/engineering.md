# What is engineering?
Have it ever occured to you what exactly is **Engineering**?

# Learn from quotes
- Engineering mathematics relies on relatively few basic concepts and involves powerful unifying principles. --- [Advanced engineering mathematics - P13](https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/ADVANCED%20ENGINEERING%20MATHEMATICS%20BY%20ERWIN%20ERESZIG1.pdf)
- Understanding(an analog design) is like understanding a language. It doesn't take long to look at a schematic and know what it is all about if you know the language.  --- Bob Dobkin, VP, Engineering, Maxim Integrated Circuits, Designer of the LM118 Op Amp
- Engineering implies *planning*: careful thoughts in advanced of building. --- [Analog Circuit Design --- Hiscocks P44](https://www.sphere.bc.ca/download/analog-circuit-design-hiscocks.pdf)
- It may bring you more to think about not only *what to do next to progress to the solution*, but also *why choosing to do this and not something else* when solving an engineering-related problem.

# Experience from beating the deadline
- When you are approaching the deadline, you will be more aware of the difference between trading off between pure study or development and the goal. So the experience obtained from approaching the deadline could withhold more merit.
## Optimizing the time consumption of micro procedures 
### Tools proficiency

## Ditching the pedantry and formalism

## Don't care about time
