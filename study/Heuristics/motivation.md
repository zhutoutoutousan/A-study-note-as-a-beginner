# Biological view
## Dopamine
### Reward pathway
The reward pathway is much more complicated than the vast majority perceives.
According to [1 - TEDxWilmingtonWomen](#resources), dopamine serves as the indicator of novelty, which is:  
**Dopamine release = Actual Reward - Expected Reward**



### How to rewire the reward pathway to maximize productivity

## Seretonin
Related with *mood* and *anxiety*

## Endocannabinoid
Related with *happiness* and *delight*

## Oxytocin
Related with *warmth* and *bonding*

## Endorphin
Related with *pleasure* and *satisfaction*

## Testosterone

## Estogen

## Optimal psychological state when studying
### Flow
## Personality
### Syndromes
#### Napoleon syndrome
#### Imposter syndrome
Counter measure
- Identify and actively acknowledge your strengths. Everybody has strengths, and being intentionally aware of them can help counterbalance self-doubts.
- Don’t give power to one or two negative comments. Realize that negative comments often come from a vocal minority amidst a silent majority of positive thoughts.
- Identify your weaknesses, and make it a point to improve on them. This is the simplest way to boost your confidence.
- Don’t compare yourself to people outside your level. Too many junior software engineers compare themselves to Jeff Dean; too many budding entrepreneurs compare themselves to Elon Musk. These comparisons are mostly meaningless.
- Trust the process. A common example of impostor syndrome is the Google Software Engineer who thinks they somehow tricked the hiring committee into hiring them. If you passed the Google interviews, trust that the Google interview process, which has been refined, polished, and fine-tuned over the last 20 years, didn’t make a mistake.

### Social economic difference
### Verbal abuse
#### The Straw man fallacy
##### Basics
An opponent's position is misrepresented to make it easier to critique, which creates the straw man fallacy.
```
A:

PREMISE1: Advertisements for beer encourage underage drinking
PREMISE2: Underage drinking often has negative consequences
CONCLUSION: Therefore, advertisements for beer should be banned from TV

B:

STRAWMAN: Yeah, but people will never give up drinking beer.


NOTE: 'A' never claimed it would be a good idea to give up drinking beer. 
```

```
A:

STRAWMAN: The theory of evolution says that humans are no different from apes
PREMISE2: Humans are different from apes because humans are obviously smarter
CONCLUSION: Therefore, the theory of evolution is false

NOTE: The theory of evolution never claimed that humans are no different from apes. 
```
