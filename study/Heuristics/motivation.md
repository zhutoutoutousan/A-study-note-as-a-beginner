# Biological view
## Dopamine
### Reward pathway
The reward pathway is much more complicated than the vast majority perceives.
According to [1 - TEDxWilmingtonWomen](#resources), dopamine serves as the indicator of novelty, which is:  
**Dopamine release = Actual Reward - Expected Reward**

## Seretonin
Related with *mood* and *anxiety*

## Endocannabinoid
Related with *happiness* and *delight*

## Oxytocin

PREMISE1: Advertisements for beer encourage underage drinking
PREMISE2: Underage drinking often has negative consequences
CONCLUSION: Therefore, advertisements for beer should be banned from TV

B:

STRAWMAN: Yeah, but people will never give up drinking beer.


NOTE: A never claimed it would be a good idea to give up drinking beer. 
```

```
A:

STRAWMAN: The theory of evolution says that humans are no different from apes
PREMISE2: Humans are different from apes because humans are obviously smarter
