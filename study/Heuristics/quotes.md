- Understanding(an analog design) is like understanding a language. It doesn't take long to look at a schematic and know what it is all about if you know the language.  --- Bob Dobkin, VP, Engineering, Maxim Integrated Circuits, Designer of the LM118 Op Amp

# Computer
- Reading about nature is fine, but if a person walks in the woods and listens carefully, they can learn more than what is in books. --- George Washington Carver


# Programming paradigm
- OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
  FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.  --- Michael Feathers(Twitter)

# Future
- Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.  --- Jeff Atwood, Author, Entrepreneur, Cofounder of StackOverflow

# Attitude
- ...When he contemplated the result, it looked as if there were nothing but a hundred identical units; but the numbers he had thought of only as names unexpectedly turned out to be peculiar entities with irreducible properties. For instance, there were even, uneven, and primary numbers: positive, negative, irrational, and imaginary numbers, etc. So it is with psychology: if the soul is really only an idea, this idea has an alarming air of unpredictability about it ---something with qualities no one would ever have imagined. One can go on asserting that the psyche is consciousness and its contents, but that does not prevent, in fact it hastens, the discovery of a background not previously suspected, a true matrix of all conscious phenomena, a preconsciousness and a postconsciousness, a superconsciousness and a subconsciousness. *The moment one forms an idea of a thing and successfully catches one of its aspects, one invariably succumbs to the illusion of having caught the whole. One never considers that a total apprehension is right out of the question. Not even an idea posited as total is total, for it is still an entity on its own with unpredictable qualities. This self-deception certainly promotes peace of mind: the unknown is named, the far has been brought near, so that one can lay one's finger on it. One has taken possession of it, and it has become an inalienable piece of property, like a slain creature of the wild that can no longer run away. It is a magical procedure such as the primitive practises upon objects and the psychologist upon the psyche.* He is no longer at its mercy, but he never suspects that the very fact of grasping the object conceptually gives it a golden opportunity to display all those qualities which would never have made their appearance had it not been imprisoned in a concept... --- **On the nature of the psyche, P92, L350, Routledge Classics, Carl Jung**

- Sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast. --- William Shakespeare *No fear Act2 Scene2*

# Engineering
- Engineering mathematics relies on relatively few basic concepts and involves powerful unifying principles. --- [Advanced engineering mathematics - P13](https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/ADVANCED%20ENGINEERING%20MATHEMATICS%20BY%20ERWIN%20ERESZIG1.pdf)
