        Let's say the coordinate of the bishop is (x, y). In the example above, x = 4, y = 5,
        assuming that we're using the y coordinates during programming. Then the bishop's movement
        has two patterns: Rising and falling.

        From the illustration we know that for a certain position X, the corresponding position for 
        Y of Bishop at (A,B) is 'B - A + X'
