# Basic concepts 
- *byte*: It's like a 8-bit chunk
- *Computer system*: A *computer system* consists of hardware and systems software that work together
to run application programs.
- *source program*: Like ```hello.c```, the *source program* is a sequence of bits, each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunk called *bytes*. Each *byte* represents some text character in the program.
# Program life cycle
A generic program(like *hello* program) begins life  as a *source program*
