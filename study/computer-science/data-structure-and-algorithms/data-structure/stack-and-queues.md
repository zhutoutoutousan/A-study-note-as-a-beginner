- [trekhleb - stack](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/stack)
  - Reading
  - JavaScript code
  - Short introduction

# Formal expression
- Please don't do this until you are sure you want to write some papers about some topics.
- Prior to that, skimming through the ```IA``` book is more than enough.
## Stack
### Pseudocode
## Queue
### Pseudocode
# Book entry
- IA:[Introduction to algorithms](https://edutechlearners.com/download/Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd%20Edition.pdf)
  - More pedantic approach
  - Helpful when you want to publish a paper are are looking for a formal way to express your ideas.
