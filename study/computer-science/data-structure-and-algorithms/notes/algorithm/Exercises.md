# The Role of Algorithms in Computing
## Algorithms
### 1.1-1
Q: Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

A:
### 1.1-2
Q: Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

A:
### 1.1-3
Q: Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths andlimitations.

### 1.1-4
Q: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman  problems given above similar?How are they different?
### 1.1-5
Q: Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do.  Thencome  up  with  one  in  which  a solution  that  is  “approximately”  the  best  is  goodenough.
