# Basic concepts
## Algorithm
- An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some values, or sets of values, as **output**.
- An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
## Data structures
- A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
## NP-complete problems
## Parallelism
