# Reading progress
## Introduction to algorithms
- [ ] Algorithms--> Getting started -->
- [ ] Data structure 

# Suggestions
- Read 'Data structure' and 'Algorithm' 
- Then read sequentially
- This book contains pseudocode, and is not typically concerned with issues of software engineering. Hence, issues of data abstraction, modularity, and error handling are often ignored in order to convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely.
