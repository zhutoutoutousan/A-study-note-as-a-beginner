# A
## Algorithm
- An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some values, or sets of values, as **output**.
- An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
## Alpha-beta pruning
- **Alpha-beta pruning** is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)

## CMTS

- The CMTS serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM--- turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.
## CO

## Context switch
### Cryptoanalysis
- studies the breaking of cryptosystems.
### Cryptography
- Cryptography concerns itself with the design of cryptosystems
### Cryptology
- *Cryptology*, the study of cryptosystems, can be subdivided into two disciplines.

# D
## Data structures
- A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
## Data type
## Dial-up
## Dictionary
- (Computer networking)Many algorithms need only the ability to insert elements into, delete elements from, and test membership in a set. We call a **dynamic** set that supports these operations a **dictionary**.
- (Python)

## Distributed application
- Applications that involve multiple end systems that exchange data with one another

## DSL
- Digital subscriber line
- Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line(DSL)** and cable.

## DSLAM
## DSL modem
## Dynamic programming
## Dynamic sets
- Sets are as fundamental to computer science as they are to mathematics. Whereas mathematical sets are unchanging, the sets manipulated by algorithms can grow, shrink, or otherwise change over time. We call such sets **dynamic**.

# E
## Efficiency
- \(Mathematica problem\): Let's say there are two algorithms for sorting, the first is **insertion sort**, which takes time roughly equal to $c_1 n^2$ to sort $n$ items, where $c_1$ is a constant that does not depend on $n$. The second, **merge sort**, takes time roughly equal to $c_2 n lgn$, where $lgn$ stands for ${log}_2 n$ and $c_2$ is another constant that also does not depend on $n$. For all $c_1$ and $c_2$, plot their time complexity curves with resepect to $n$.
## End systems
- For example, the phone we use
- End systems are also referred to as *hosts* because they host(i.e. run) application programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program.
## Ethernet
# F
## Formal verification
In the context of hardware and software systems, **formal verification** is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics. 
## Frequency-division multiplexing
## FTTH
- Fiber To The Home
# H
## Hash Table/Hash map
- In computing, a **hash table**(hash map) is a data structure whic himplements an *associative array* abstract data type, a structure that can map *keys to values*. A hash table uses a *hash function* to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash tabel designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause has collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions must be accomodated in some way.

## HFC network
## Host
## Hub 集线器
- A hub doesn't filter data or has any intelligence as to where the data should be sent.
- The only thing the hub knows is when the device is connected to one of its ports, when a data packet arrives at one of the ports, it is copied to all of the other ports.

# I
## Internet Protocol(IP)
- The TCP and IP are two of the most important protocols in the Internet
- The IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems
## IoT
- Internet of Things

# L
## Linear probing
## Linked List
- In computer science, a **linked list** is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. 
- Drawback: Access time is linear(and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible.
- Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.
- [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/linked-list)
## Load factor
- (Hash algorithm) Load factor = $\frac{Total\,\, number\, of\, items\, stored}{Size\,of\,the\,array}$
# M
## MAC address
## Memoization
- In computing, **memoization** or memoisation is an optimization technique  used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20memoization%20or%20memoisation,the%20same%20inputs%20occur%20again.)
## Modifying operations
- Operations on a dynamic set can be grouped into two categories: **queries**, which simply return information about the set, an 
- Typical modifying operations
  - $SEARCH(S,k)$: A query that, given a set $S$ and a key value $k$, returns a pointer $x$ to an element in $S$ such that $x.key=k$, or $NIL$ if no such element belongs to $S$.
  - $INSERT(S,x)$: A modifying operation that augments the set $S$ with the element pointed to by $x$. We usually assume that any attributes in element $x$ needed by the set implementation have already been initialized.
  - $DELETE(S,x)$: A modifying operation that, given a pointer $x$ to an element in the set $S$, removes $x$ from $S$.
    - This operation takes a pointer to an element $x$, not a key value.
  - $MINIMUM(S)$: A query on a totally ordered set $S$ that returns a pointer to the element of $S$ with the smallest key.
  - $MAXIMMUM(S)$: A query on a totally ordered set $S$ that returns a pointer to the element of $S$ with the largest key.
  - $SUCCESSOR(S,x)$: A query that, given an element $x$ whose key is from a totally ordered set $S$, returns a pointer to the next larger element in $S$, or $NIL$ if $x$ is the maximum element.
  - $PREDECESSOR(S,x)$: A query that, given an element $x$ whose key is from a totally ordered set $S$, returns a pointer to the next smaller element in $S$, or $NIL$ if $x$ is the minimum element.

- A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the action taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event


# Q
## Queue
- (Data structure)See the **queue** section.

# R
## Randomized algorithm
## Recursive
Many useful algorithms are **recursive** in structure: to solve a given problrm, they call themselves recursively one or more times to deal with closely related sub-problems.
### Router


# S
## Satellite data
- In a typical implementation of a dynamic set, each elements is represented by an object whose attributes can be examined and manipulated if we have a pointer to the object. Some kinds of dynamic  sets assume that one of the object's attributes is an identifying **key**. If the keys are all different, we can think of the dynamic set as being a set of key values. The object may contain **satellite data**, which are carried around in other object attributes but are otherwise unused by the set implementation. It may also have attributes that are manipulated by the set operations; these attributes may contain data or pointers to other objects in the set.
