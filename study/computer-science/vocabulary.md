# A
## Algorithm
- An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some values, or sets of values, as **output**.
- An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.

# D
## Data structures
- A **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

# E
## Efficiency
- \(Mathematica problem\): Let's say there are two algorithms for sorting, the first is **insertion sort**, which takes time roughly equal to $c_1 n^2$ to sort $n$ items, where $c_1$ is a constant that does not depend on $n$. The second, **merge sort**, takes time roughly equal to $c_2 n lgn$, where $lgn$ stands for ${log}_2 n$ and $c_2$ is another constant that also does not depend on $n$. For all $c_1$ and $c_2$, plot their time complexity curves with resepect to $n$.

# F
## Formal verification
In the context of hardware and software systems, **formal verification** is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics.
