# Overview
- This note is analogous to RAM in computer systems
  - Your short-term memory(Cache) is not enough
- This note is created at the top-level of the cute little system of yours delicated to:
  - Record the current mental challenges upon which is possible to reap the most benifits pondering whenever you are pinching a loaf in the bathroom, showering or masturbating.
  - Some problems has some context that requires some reviewing for itself to be clear in your mind when you reached the state that you can think about it when in diffuse mode. 
- After the problem or challenge has been completed and doesn't require any more thinking when working out, commuting and so on, migrate it to the corresponding space(Hard disc)
- This note also stores some exercises that, at that very moment, you don't have the taste for it but want to do it some time later
# Mathematics, DS & As
## Pyramid path
- [Project Euler Maximum path sum I](https://projecteuler.net/problem=18)
- [Pyramid Slide down](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f23362ff852e2ab000037/train/javascript)
### Approach
- Tree + dijkstra/ path searching + backtrack?
  - MENTAL ELEMENT NEEDED:
    - BACKTRACK
      - You do have a ```tic-tac-toe``` game in the React.js beginner tutorial, why don't you mix it with this exercise?
        - Process(React.js)
          - [ ] Restore 'savegame' of react.js study
    - GRAPH SEARCHING ALGORITHM
      - Code along with [javascript-algorithm](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) 
        - [ ] Graph searching algorithms
          - [ ] Understanding
          - [ ] Mental-model
            - [ ] Write it down if you had some
          - [ ] Code(OOP)
        - [ ] Tree data structure in JavaScript
      - Consider strengthening memory using spaced repetition if needed
- Binary search + index match
  - Start as soon as you completed the session above


# Mabye later
## Matrix determinent
- [Codewar - matrix determinent](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a382ee44408cea2500074c/train/javascript)
  - I want to combine this training with mathematic reading, but I don't want to right now, mabye later

## Figure out what currying is about
- Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments(or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument
- [Method Chaining & Currying javascript](https://medium.com/@anilchaudhary453/method-chaining-currying-javascript-b6fc3324592c#:~:text=currying%20is%20the%20technique%20of,each%20with%20a%20single%20argument.)
  - [The arguments object - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
  - [JavaScript ES6: Spread Operator and Rest Parameters](https://medium.com/@luke_smaki/javascript-es6-spread-operator-and-rest-parameters-b3e89d112281#:~:text=The%20spread%20operator%20allows%20us,access%20them%20in%20an%20array.)
  - [Stack Overflow - How to get a slice from “arguments”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9510094/how-to-get-a-slice-from-arguments)
- [A Chain adding function - Codewar](https://www.codewars.com/kata/539a0e4d85e3425cb0000a88/train/javascript)
- Maybe adding step through to watch the process
  - How to use devtool to step through codes in the console?
