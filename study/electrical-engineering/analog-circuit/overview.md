# Design paradigms

# Design purposes and bottlenecks
## Single application
- It works, then Voila
- Used to verify an idea(e.g. scientific exploration)
  - With the results in hand, the circuit is scrap.
  - Combination of ideas can result in bugs. What methods could come in handy?
  - The cost of time outweighs the money spent on components and assemblies.
  - Use of pre-assembled components recommended

## Consumer-grade product built in large quantities
- The cost is critical
  - The cost of the parts
  - The cost of the labour to assemble them
- Some engineering nightmares
  - Product recalls
  - Warranty repairs
  - Field failures
- Engineering standards
 - The design must be *engineered* to meet requirements of cost, function and reliability.
