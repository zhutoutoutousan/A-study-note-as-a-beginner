# Alphabetical
## A
### Analog signal
- In analog form, the magnitude of some voltage or current represents the original signal.
## B
### Bode plot
## C
### Circuit Response
- Circuits generally have inputs and outputs.
- It is safe to say that a circuit isn't useful if it doesn't have one or the other *circuit response*(usually both).
- Circuit response is the relationship between the circuit's input to the circuit's output.
- The circuit response may be a measure of either current or voltage.
## E
### Electricity
- Electricity is a convenient way of moving and distributing energy at a central location(the power plant) to the end user, where it powers your lights, refrigerator and computer.
## F
### Fourier transform
### Frequency domain
- The frequency domain are graphs of power, voltage and/or current that depend upon frequency such as Bode plots.
## O 
### ODE
- ODE: Ordinary Differential Equations
## P
### Power System
- Power system concerns the generation and transmission of electrical energy.
### Protoboard
## S
### Signal
- *Signal* concerns the use of electricity to convey information. 
- The representation of the signal can be *analog* or *digital*
- Signals almost always begin in analog format.

### Spectrogram
### Steady State
### Stray capacitance
## T
### Time domain
- The time domain is described by graphs of power, voltage and current that depend upon time. 
- The 'Time domain' is simply another way of saying that out circuits change with time, and that the major variable used to describe the system is time.
- Another name for 'Time domain' is 'Temporal'
### Transient Response
- A transient response occurs when
  - a circuit is turned on or off
  - a sensor responds to the physical world changes static electricity is discharged
  - an old car with old spark plugs(before resistors were put in spark plugs) drives by
- Transient means momentary, or a short period of time & the energy in a circuit suddenly changes which causes the energy storage elements to react.
### Transmission line
