# Alphabetical
## A
### Analog signal
- In analog form, the magnitude of some voltage or current represents the original signal.
## B
### Bode plot
## C
### Circuit Response
- Circuits generally have inputs and outputs.
- It is safe to say that a circuit isn't useful if it doesn't have one or the other *circuit response*(usually both).
- Circuit response is the relationship between the circuit's input to the circuit's output.
- The circuit response may be a measure of either current or voltage.
## D
## E
### Electricity
- Electricity is a convenient way of moving and distributing energy at a central location(the power plant) to the end user, where it powers your lights, refrigerator and computer.
### Electronic Charge
- An *Electronic Charge* may be thought of as a collection of electrons.
- The unit of electronic charge is the *coulomb*(Symbol: C), equal to the total charge on $6.242\times 10^{18}$ electrons: $1\:coulumb=6.242\times 10^{18} q_e$, where $q_e$  is the charge on an individual electron.
- A charge created by a surplus of electrons is negative.
- A charge created by a *deficiency* of electrons is positive.
## F
### Fourier transform
### Frequency domain
- The frequency domain are graphs of power, voltage and/or current that depend upon frequency such as Bode plots.
## M
### Millikan Oil-Drop experiment
- [Millikan Oil Drop Experiment Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwnjYERS66U)
- The charge $q_e$(See **Electric charge**) can be measured using this experiment.
### MKS system
## O 
### ODE
- ODE: Ordinary Differential Equations
- For more check **Mathematics** section
## P
### Power System
- Power system concerns the generation and transmission of electrical energy.
### Potential difference
### ppm
- ppm: parts per million.
- Voltage drift is measured in *ppm*
- See **voltage standards**
### Protoboard
## S
### Signal
- *Signal* concerns the use of electricity to convey information. 
- The representation of the signal can be *analog* or *digital*
- Signals almost always begin in analog format.
### Static electricity
### Spectrogram
### Steady State
### Stray capacitance
## T
### Time domain
- The time domain is described by graphs of power, voltage and current that depend upon time. 
- The 'Time domain' is simply another way of saying that out circuits change with time, and that the major variable used to describe the system is time.
- Another name for 'Time domain' is 'Temporal'
## V
### Voltage
- Voltage is defined in terms of the work required to move a charge between two points at different potential.
- One volt is the potential difference between two points when the work required to move one coulomb of charge between them is one joule: $W = QV$, where $V$ is the voltage difference between two points, $Q$ is the charge being moved in coulombs, and $W$ is the work in joules.
### Voltage standards
- $W=QV$ in MKS system
### Voltmeter
- A *voltmeter* is a device to measure the potential difference(voltage) between two points in a circuit.
- An ideal voltmeter conducts no current, like an electrical open circuit.
- *Loading effect*: When a voltmeter is not ideal, it affects the circuit and the voltage at that point in the circuit changes when the meter is attached.
### Transient Response
- A transient response occurs when
  - a circuit is turned on or off
  - a sensor responds to the physical world changes static electricity is discharged
  - an old car with old spark plugs(before resistors were put in spark plugs) drives by
- Transient means momentary, or a short period of time & the energy in a circuit suddenly changes which causes the energy storage elements to react.
### Transmission line
