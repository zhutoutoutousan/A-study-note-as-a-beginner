# TODO
- Fill in the gaps
  - Dude, seriously, plz fill in the pre-rehersed workout plans for 'I just worked 8 hours and I don't want the workout to reduce my academic/tech performance', 'I don't want to do the compound lift but still want to train these parts, what do you suggest?(It needs to be smark ;p)

# Assess and adjust
## Example
- Shoulder: Weakness on the left side
- Bicep: Weakness on the right side 
# Heads-ups
- The calory burn got by the resistance band for free training is probably not accurate. Use ```myfitnesspal``` data instead.
