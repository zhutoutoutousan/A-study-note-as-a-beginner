## Logical operations
### Equality
- Two matrices $\bold{A} = [a_{jk}]$ and $\bold{B} = [b_{jk}]$ are **equal**, written $\bold{A} = \bold{B}$, if and only if they have the same size and the corresponding entries are equal, that is, $a_{11}=b_{11}, a_{12}=b_{12}$, and so on. Matrices that are not equal are called **different**. Thus, matrices of different sizes are always different.
- No examples needed to explain
## Interactions
### Addition
- No furthur explanation needed for now except some exposure to the syntax.
### Multiplication
#### Scalar multiplication
- The **product** of any $m\times n$ matrix $\bold{A}=[a_{jk}]$ and any **scalar** *c*(number *c*) is written $c\bold{A}$
