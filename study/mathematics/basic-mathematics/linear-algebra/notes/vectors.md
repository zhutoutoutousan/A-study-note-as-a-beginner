# Definitions and notations
## Vector
### Vector.definition
A vector is an ordered finite list of numbers.


### Vector.elements
- Elements(Entries, coefficinets, components): The values in the array.
- scalars: The numbers or values of the elements in a vector.
- Subvectors: Let's say there is a vector of some vectors concatenated together $a_{r:s} = (a_r,...,a_s)$(yields size $s-r+1$), this sort of way to denote subvectors are called *colon notation*.

### Vector.property
- Size(dimension or length): The number of elements it contains.
### Vector.instance
- real vector
- complex vector
### Vector.relations
- equal: Vector $a=b$, if they have the same size, and each of the corresponding entries is the same.
### Vector.methods
- Concatenation(stacking): Like duh. But, can you sort of find a way that sort of map the abnormal points or patterns?


### Vector.notations
- Agreement source: [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra - Stephen Boyd](../pdf/introduction-to-applied-linear-algebra.pdf)
- A simple vector 

$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
        a \\
        b \\
        c \\
        d
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

- $n-vector$ : A vector of size $n$
- Query: a\[i\] === $a_i$
- $a$ is an $n-vector$ with real entries: $a \in {\bold{R}}^n$
