# Before starting 
## Why should I learn Mathematical logic?
## How do I learn Mathematical logic well?
- Impeccable definitions have little value at the beginning of the study of a subject
## What's the difference between the mathematicians' logic and the logicians' logic?
| Mathematician | Logician |
| ----------------- |:----:|
|  | The truth or falsity of the particular premisses and conclusions is of no concern to logicians but whether the premisses imply the conclusion |
|  | The systematic formalization and cataloguing of valid methods of reasoning are a main task of logicians  |




# Basic concepts
## *Mathematical logic*
- If the work uses mathematical techniques or if it is primarily devoted to the study of mathematical reasoning, then it may be called *mathematical logic*.
## *Mathematical proof*
