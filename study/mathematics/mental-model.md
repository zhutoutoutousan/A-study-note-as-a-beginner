## Geology
### General
- General equation of a circle with the radius $R$: $x^2+y^2 = R^2$
- Degrees vs radians:
  - A full circle is 360 degrees and $2\pi$ radians.
  - 1 radian = 360/2 $\pi$ degrees $\approx$ 57.3 degrees
  - 1 degree = $2\pi /360$ radians $\approx$ 0.01745 radians
  - Examples discussing radians: **CM** p23
### Trignometry
- $\cos^2{x}+\sin^2{x}=1$
- Basic triangle model
  - $\cos{\theta} = \frac{x}{r} = \frac{near\,side}{hypotenuse}$
  - $\sin{\theta} = \frac{y}{r} = \frac{opposite\,side}{hypotenuse}$
  - $\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{opposite\,side}{near\,side}=\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}$
  - $\sec{\theta} = \frac{r}{x} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$
  - $\csc{\theta} = \frac{r}{y} = \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}}$
  - $\cot{\theta} = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}}=\frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}}$

- The surface area of a sphere: $S=4\pi r^2$

## Systems of Units
### Unit-real-life comparison
### Unit conversion

- 1 mil = ? mm

## Calculus
### Differentiation
- $(\frac{u}{v})^{'}=\frac{u^{'}v-uv^{'}}{v^2}$
  - Entry of usage:
    - Usage 1:
- $\frac{du}{dx}=\frac{du}{dy}\dot \frac{dy}{dx}$
  - Usual usage scenarios:
    - Usage 1:
- ${(a^x)}^{'}=a^x \ln{a}$
- ${(\tan{x})}^{'}={\sec^2{x}}$
- ${(\cot{x})}^{'}={-\csc^2{x}}$
- ${(\sinh{x})}^{'}={\cosh{x}}$
- ${(\cosh{x})}^{'}={\sinh{x}}$
- ${(\log_a{x})}^{'}=\frac{\log_a{e}}{x}$

### Integration
- $\int kdx = kx+C$(k is constant)
- $\int x^{\mu}dx = \frac{x^{\mu+1}}{\mu +1}+C$($\mu \neq -1$)
- $\int \frac{dx}{x}= \ln{|x|}+C$
- $\int \frac{dx}{1+x^2}=\arctan{x}+C$
- $\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}=\arcsin{x}+C$
- $\int \cos{x}dx = \sin{x} + C$
- $\int \sin{x}dx = -\cos{x} + C$
- $\int \frac{dx}{\cos^2{x}}= \int \sec^2{x}dx = \tan{x}+C$
- $\int \frac{dx}{\sin^2{x}}= \int \csc^2{x}dx = -\cot{x}+C$
- $\int \sec{x}\tan{x}dx = \sec{x}+C$
- $\int \csc{x}\cot{x}dx = -\csc{x}+C$
