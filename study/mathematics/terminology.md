### Matrice
- **Matrices** are rectangular arrays of numbers or functions, and **vectors** are the main tools of linear algebra. It is important for it let us express large amount of data and functions in an organized and concise form.
- Matrices are single objects, denoted by single letters and calculated directly
- Matrices are very popular for expressing scientific and mathematical ideas.

### Matrix
- A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers or functions enclosed in brackets. The numbers(or functions) are called **entries** or, less commonly, *elements* of the matrix.
- Some descriptors like **rows** and **columns**, **indices**
- Some particular matrices like **square matrices**, **vectors**(Matrices having just a single row or column), **row vector**, **column vector**.
- Some examples of matrixes

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 1 & -5 \\
0 & -0.2 & 16 
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ 
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{-x} & 2x^2 \\
e^{6x} & 4x
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
\frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Matrices are handy for storing and processing data in applications. 
### Modeling
- If we want to solve an engineering problem(usually of a physical nature), we first have to formulate the problem as a mathematical expression in terms of variables, functions, and equations. Such an expression is known as a mathematical model of the given problem. The process of setting up a model, solving it mathematically, and interpreting the result in physical or other terms is called *mathematical modeling* or, briefly, **modeling**.
- The four stages of using mathematical modeling to solve a real problem?

## L
### Linear algebra
- Linear algebra is a fairly extensive subject that covers vectors and matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations, eigenvalue problems, and other topics.
- It can be applied to engineering, physics, geometry, computer science, economics, and other areas. It also helps us have a deeper understanding of mathematics itself.
### Linear system
- Some examples of linear systems
  - $$

    \end{bmatrix}
