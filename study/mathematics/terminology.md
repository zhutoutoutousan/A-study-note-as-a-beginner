- **Matrices** are rectangular arrays of numbers or functions, and **vectors** are the main tools of linear algebra. It is important for it let us express large amount of data and functions in an organized and concise form.
- Matrices are single objects, denoted by single letters and calculated directly
- Matrices are very popular for expressing scientific and mathematical ideas.

### Matrix
- Matrices are denoted by capital boldface letters $\bold{A},\bold{B}, \bold{C},...$, or by writing the general entry in brackets; thus $\bold{A} = [a_{jk}]$, and so on. A matrix with *m* rows and *n* columns can be denoted by $\bold{m}\bold{\times}\bold{n}$ **matrix**. The size of the matrix is $m\times n$. You can also say 'some matrices are of sizes $a\times b, c\times d...$'.
- A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers or functions enclosed in brackets. The numbers(or functions) are called **entries** or, less commonly, *elements* of the matrix.
- Some descriptors like **rows** and **columns**, **indices**, **main diagonal**.
- Some particular matrices like **square matrices**, **vectors**(Matrices having just a single row or column), **row vector**, **column vector**, **zero vector**. 
- Some examples of matrixes

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 1 & -5 \\
0 & -0.2 & 16 
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ 
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
e^{-x} & 2x^2 \\
e^{6x} & 4x
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
\frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Matrices are handy for storing and processing data in applications. 
### Modeling
- If we want to solve an engineering problem(usually of a physical nature), we first have to formulate the problem as a mathematical expression in terms of variables, functions, and equations. Such an expression is known as a mathematical model of the given problem. The process of setting up a model, solving it mathematically, and interpreting the result in physical or other terms is called *mathematical modeling* or, briefly, **modeling**.
- The four stages of using mathematical modeling to solve a real problem?

## L
### Linear algebra
- Linear algebra is a fairly extensive subject that covers vectors and matrices, determinants, systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations, eigenvalue problems, and other topics.
- It can be applied to engineering, physics, geometry, computer science, economics, and other areas. It also helps us have a deeper understanding of mathematics itself.
### Linear system
- Some concepts like **unknowns** e.g. $x_1,x_2$ in the following examples. Some **coefficient matrix**, called $\bold{A}$ by listing the coefficients of the **unknowns** in the position in which they appear in the linear equations. As shown in $\tilde{A}$ equation, by augmenting $\bold{A}$ with the right sides of the linear system and call it the augmented matrix of the system.


$$
\bold{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 6 & 9\\
6 & 0 & -2\\
5 & -8 & 1
\end{bmatrix},

\tilde{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 6 & 9 & 6\\
6 & 0 & -2 & 20\\
5 & -8 & 1 & 10
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- Some examples of linear systems
  - $$
    \begin{matrix}
      4x_1 + 6x_2 + 9x_3 = 6 \\
      6x_1  - 2x_3 = 20 \\
      5x_1 - 8x_2 + x_3 = 10
    \end{matrix}
    $$

### Linear transformation

## V
### Vector
- A **vector** is a matrix with only one row or column. Its **entries** are called the **components** of the vector.
- A **vector** is denoted by **lowercase** boldface letters **a**, **b**,... or by its general component in brackets, **a** = [$a_j$], and so on.
