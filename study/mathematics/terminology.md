### Modeling
- If we want to solve an engineering problem(usually of a physical nature), we first have to formulate the problem as a mathematical expression in terms of variables, functions, and equations. Such an expression is known as a mathematical model of the given problem. The process of setting up a model, solving it mathematically, and interpreting the result in physical or other terms is called *mathematical modeling* or, briefly, **modeling**.
