# Issues

## ```About:blank#blocked```
When I first opened my machine, tried to drag the html file from the file explorer in Vscode, the browsers gives back the ```About:blank#blocked```, but after I opened some tabs like *pornhub*, everything went back to normal.

Thoughts: For security reasons, when you haven't opened any tabs, the browser will set the state as *Initial state*. The browser prohibits any actions that trys to open a site outside itself by directing it to ```About:blank#blocked```.
