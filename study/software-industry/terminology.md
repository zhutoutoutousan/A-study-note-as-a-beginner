# Alphabetical
## A
### Abstraction
- (Object-oriented programming)Creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for programming purposes.
## B
### Boostrap

## C
### Command line argument
### Computed
- (Vue.js)
### Class
- (ES6)
- (java)A java class is a group of data items with associated functions that can perform operations on that data. The data items in a calss are called *variables*, or sometimes *fields*; in Java, functions are called *methods*.
  - As in other object-oriented languages, classes are application components that hold executable code and data. Compiled Java classes are distributed in a universal binary format that contains Java bytecode and other class information.
  - Java class can be maintained discretly and stored in files or archives locally or on a network server.
  - Java classes are located and loaded dynamically at runtime as they are needed by an application.
### Closure
### Cluster
A group of servers that stores your data
### Code bundler
### Communication links

## D
### Devious
- (adj)showing a skillful use of underhanded tactics to achieve goals
### Discord
- Discord is a proprietary freeware instant messaging and VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses.
## E
### Encapsulation
### Execusion context 执行上下文
- (ECMAScript)**Execution context** is a concept in the language spec that---in Layman's terms---roughly equates to the 'environment' a function executes in, i.e., variable scope(and the *scope chain*, variables)
  - [What is the 'Execution Context' in JavaScript exactly?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9384758/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript-exactly#:~:text=Execution%20context%20is%20a%20concept,value%20of%20the%20this%20object.)
  - [ECMA-262-3 in detail. Chapter 1. Execution Contexts.](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-1-execution-contexts/)
## G
### Gtk APP

## I
### IDE
- IDE: Integrated Development Environment
### IEEE 802
### IIFE
- IIFE:Immediately Invoked Function Expression
  - An immediately invoked function expression is a JavaScript programming language idiom which produces a lexical scope using JavaScript's function scoping.
### Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF)
### Inheritance
### Internet Service Providers(ISPs)
- E.g. local cable or telephone companies, corporate ISPs, university ISPs. Some ISPs can provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places, and cellular data ISPs, providing mobile access to our smartphones and other public places.
- Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switched and communication links.
### Internet standards
## J
### Java
- Java is both a compiled and an interpreted language. Java source code is turned into simple binary instructions, much like ordinary microprocessor machine code.
  - See virtual machine
- The fundamental unit of Java code is the *class*

### Java build tools
- Examples
  - Maven
### Java Bytecode
- (java)Compiled Java *bytecode* is executed by a Java runtime interpreter.
### Java data type
- In Java, every class defines a new *data type* 

### Java inheritance
### Java interperter
### Java method
- See ```java``` section
### Java native methods
- In addition to the platform-specific runtime system, Java has a number of fundamental classes that contain architecture-depenedent methods. These *native methods* serve as the gateway between the Java virtual machine and the real world. They are implemented in a natively compiled language on the host platform and provide low-level access to resources such as the network, the windowing system, and the host filesystem.
### Java object reference
- A *reference* is a pointer to or a handle for an object.
- If you declare a class-type variable without assigning it an object, it doens't point to anything. It's assigned the default value of ```null```, meaning 'no value'. If you try to use a variable with a null value as if it were poingting to a real object, a runtime error, ```NullPointerException```, occurs.
### Java runtime
### Java virtual machine
- (java)Whereas ```C``` or ```C++``` source is reduced to native instructions for a particular model of processor, Java source is compiled into a universal format---instructions for a *virtual machine*

### JDK
- JDK: Java Developement Kit
### JIT
- JIT: just-in-time or dynamic compilation
  - Java has been carefully designed so that software implementations of the runtime system can further optimize their performance by compiling bytecode to native machine code on the fly.
### JFC
### JRE
- JRE: Java Runtime Environment
- Examples
  - Execution environment
    - JavaSE
  - Project specific JRE
  
## M
### Methods
- (Vue.js) Methods in Vue.js are bound to the Vue instance, they are incredibly useful for  functions you would like to access in directives
- You can use arrow functions within the method, but the method cannot be an arrow function
### MVC
- **Model-view-controller** is a *software design pattern* commonly used for developing *user interfaces* that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
- [Model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
  - Check the anatomy graph
- Definitions:
  - **Model**: The central components of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **View**: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table.
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **Controller**: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view
    - Vue.js:
    - React.js:
  - **Service**: Between the controller and the model sometimes goes a layer which is called a service. It fetches data from the model and lets the controller use the fetched data.   
## N
### Name space
### Non-Basic-Multilingual-Plane character
## O
### Object-oriented inheritance model
### Object-oriented language
- ?
  - The primary benefits of an object-oriented language are this association between data and functionality in class units and also the ability of classes to *encapsulate* or hide details, freeing the developer from worrying about low-level details.
### Object-oriented programming
## P
### PaaS
- PaaS: Platform as a service
- **Platform as a service(PaaS)** or **application platform as a service(aPaaS)** or platform-based service is a category of *cloud computing services* that provides a *platform* allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
- [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)
- Examples
  - Heroku
### Packet switch
### Promise
- (Web API)A **promise** is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a *promise* to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A **promise** is in one of these states:
  - *pending*: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - *fulfilled*: meaning that the operation completed
## R
### React element
- (React.js)```render``` returns a **React element**

### Reactive programming
- (Front-end) Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams.

  - Angular 1.x: **dirty checking**
  - Cycle.js/Angular 2: **Reactive streams**, **XStream**, and **Rx.js**
  - Vue.js, MobX/Reactive.js: **getters/setters**
### React.js
- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It lets you compose UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "Components"
### React component class/type
```javascript
class ThisIsAComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // JSX
    );
  }
}

```
### Replica set
A cluster where each server stores the same data
### Requests for comments(RFCs)
### Routing
**Routing** refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on). [\[express.js\]](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html)
### Runtime system
### RxJS
## S
### Scalability
### Scope
### Service
The term **Web service(WS)** is either:
- a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web,or
- a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents(HTML, JSON, XML, images), and creating web application services, which serve in solving specific domain problems over the Web(WWW, Internet, HTTP).  See more at [wikipaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)

### Software architecture
- **Software architecture** refers to the fundamental structures of a *software system* and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.
- [Software architecture - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

### Software design pattern
### Stream
- (Front-end) A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time that offer some hooks with which to observe it.
## T
### TDZ
### Traditional Gtk
- Traditional Gtk App means, it cannot be Firefox, Libreoffice, which only use Gtk as a UI style
### Transmission rate
### Transportability
## U 
### Unified Modeling Language(UML)

### URI
### User interface(UI)

## V
### Vue instance
- The Vue instance is the middleman between the DOM and the business logic
### Vue.js
### Virtual DOM
- (vue.js)?
  - Calculations in JavaScript are relatively cheap, but not so when reaching into the DOM
### VoIP
- Voice over Internet Protocol, also called IP telephony, is a method and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol networks, such as the Internet.
### Vue
- Vue is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
### Vue watcher
- (Vue.js)?
  - Watch updates the DOM only if it's required-performing calcualtions in JS is really performant but accessing the DOM is not. So we have a Virtual DOM which is like a copy, but parsed in JavaScript
  - Good for asynchronous updates, and updates/transitions with data changes
